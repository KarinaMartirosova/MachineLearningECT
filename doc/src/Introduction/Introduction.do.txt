======= Introduction =======

During the last two decades there has been a swift and amazing
development of Machine Learning techniques and algorithms that impact
many areas in not only Science and Technology but also the Humanities,
Social Sciences, Medicine, Law, indeed, almost all possible
disciplines. The applications are incredibly many, from self-driving
cars to solving high-dimensional differential equations or complicated
quantum mechanical many-body problems. Machine Learning is perceived
by many as one of the main disruptive techniques nowadays. 

Statistics, Data science and Machine Learning form important
fields of research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and
make predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract
important correlations about physical process and the underlying laws
of motion in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear
frequently in essentially all disciplines, from the traditional
Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life
Science, Law, education research, the Humanities and the Social
Sciences.


!split
===== Machine Learning, short overview  =====

Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is
that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns
in a broad class of data sets without having to write code
specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic
based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that
machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The
insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central
role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. 

Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young
age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in
computational capabilities have been followed by developments of
methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,
relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The
field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software libraries
written in Python for machine learning like
"Scikit-learn":"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/",
"Tensorflow":"https://www.tensorflow.org/",
"PyTorch":"http://pytorch.org/" and "Keras":"https://keras.io/", all
freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass
communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of
code developers and contributors keeps increasing.

!split
=====  A multidisciplinary approach =====

Not all the
algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical
justification (for example decision trees and random forests), opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and
trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a
solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability
theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte
Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many
of the algorithms and methods we will discuss.


!split 
===== Learning outcomes =====

These sets of lectures aim at giving you an overview of central aspects of
statistical data analysis as well as some of the central algorithms
used in machine learning.  We will introduce a variety of central
algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and
machine learning. 

Hands-on projects and experimenting with data and algorithms plays a central role in
these lectures, and our hope is, through the various examples discussed in this series of lectures,
to  expose you to fundamental
research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of
the art scientific results. You  will learn to develop and
structure codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with
computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A
good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the
course. More specifically, you will

===== Types of Machine Learning =====


The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into
two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a
problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other
hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and
relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely
*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by
behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,
solely from rewards and punishment.

Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the
desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:

!bpop
  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.
!epop



!split
===== Essential elements of ML =====

The methods we cover have three main topics in common, irrespective of
whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning.

The first
ingredient is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into
training and test data), the second item is a model which is normally a
function of some parameters.  The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determin our model. 

The last ingredient is a so-called _cost_
function which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model
is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train.  
At the heart of basically all ML algorithms there are so-called minimization algorithms, often we end up with various variants of _gradient_ methods.








!split
===== Choice of Programming Language =====

Python plays nowadays a central role in the development of machine
learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, seen
the wealth of machine learning and data analysis libraries written in
Python, easy to use libraries with immediate visualization(and not the
least impressive galleries of existing examples), the popularity of the
Jupyter notebook framework with the possibility to run _R_ codes or
compiled programs written in C++, and much more made our choice of
programming language for this series of lectures easy. However,
since the focus here is not only on using existing Python libraries such
as _Scikit-Learn_, _Tensorflow_ and _Pytorch_, but also on developing your own
algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these
algorithms either as a Python codes or C++ or Fortran (or other languages) codes. 






!split
===== Software and needed installations =====

We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
myriad of available libraries.  You will find
Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run _R_
codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of
visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,
Rust, Julia, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be
on Python.


If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel
pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
you install the following Python packages via _pip_ as 

o pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow 

For Python3, replace _pip_ with _pip3_.

For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
install _brew_. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
software via for example 

o brew install python3

For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
you can use _pip_ as well and simply install Python as 

o sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)

etc etc. 


!split
===== Python installers =====

If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
dependencies for Python, namely 

* "Anaconda":"https://docs.anaconda.com/", 

which is an open source
distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
are managed by the package management system _conda_. 

* "Enthought canopy":"https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" 

is a Python
distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and
analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial
license.

Furthermore, "Google's Colab":"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb" is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!

!split
===== Useful Python libraries =====
Here we list several useful Python libraries we strongly recommend (if you use anaconda many of these are already there)

* "NumPy":"https://www.numpy.org/" is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* "The pandas":"https://pandas.pydata.org/" library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools 
* "Xarray":"http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/" is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!
* "Scipy":"https://www.scipy.org/" (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
* "Matplotlib":"https://matplotlib.org/" is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
* "Autograd":"https://github.com/HIPS/autograd" can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives
* "SymPy":"https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
* "scikit-learn":"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis
* "TensorFlow":"https://www.tensorflow.org/" is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google
* "Keras":"https://keras.io/" is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
* And many more such as "pytorch":"https://pytorch.org/",  "Theano":"https://pypi.org/project/Theano/" etc

!split
===== Numpy and arrays =====
"Numpy":"http://www.numpy.org/" provides an easy way to handle arrays in Python. The standard way to import this library is as

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
!ec
Here follows a simple example where we set up an array of ten elements, all determined by random numbers drawn according to the normal distribution,
!bc pycod
n = 10
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
print(x)
!ec
We defined a vector $x$ with $n=10$ elements with its values given by the Normal distribution $N(0,1)$.
Another alternative is to declare a vector as follows
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x)
!ec
Here we have defined a vector with three elements, with $x_0=1$, $x_1=2$ and $x_2=3$. Note that both Python and C++
start numbering array elements from $0$ and on. This means that a vector with $n$ elements has a sequence of entities $x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n-1}$. We could also let (recommended) Numpy to compute the logarithms of a specific array as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8]))
print(x)
!ec

!split
===== More Examples =====

In the last example we used Numpy's unary function $np.log$. This function is
highly tuned to compute array elements since the code is vectorized
and does not require looping. We normaly recommend that you use the
Numpy intrinsic functions instead of the corresponding _log_ function
from Python's _math_ module. The looping is done explicitely by the
_np.log_ function. The alternative, and slower way to compute the
logarithms of a vector would be to write

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
from math import log
x = np.array([4, 7, 8])
for i in range(0, len(x)):
    x[i] = log(x[i])
print(x)
!ec
We note that our code is much longer already and we need to import the _log_ function from the _math_ module. 
The attentive reader will also notice that the output is $[1, 1, 2]$. Python interprets automagically our numbers as integers (like the _automatic_ keyword in C++). To change this we could define our array elements to be double precision numbers as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4, 7, 8], dtype = np.float64))
print(x)
!ec
or simply write them as double precision numbers (Python uses 64 bits as default for floating point type variables), that is
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x)
!ec
To check the number of bytes (remember that one byte contains eight bits for double precision variables), you can use simple use the _itemsize_ functionality (the array $x$ is actually an object which inherits the functionalities defined in Numpy) as 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
x = np.log(np.array([4.0, 7.0, 8.0])
print(x.itemsize)
!ec

!split
===== Matrices in Python =====

Having defined vectors, we are now ready to try out matrices. We can
define a $3 \times 3 $ real matrix $\hat{A}$ as (recall that we user
lowercase letters for vectors and uppercase letters for matrices)

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
print(A)
!ec
If we use the _shape_ function we would get $(3, 3)$ as output, that is verifying that our matrix is a $3\times 3$ matrix. We can slice the matrix and print for example the first column (Python organized matrix elements in a row-major order, see below) as
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[:,0]) 
!ec
We can continue this was by printing out other columns or rows. The example here prints out the second column
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
A = np.log(np.array([ [4.0, 7.0, 8.0], [3.0, 10.0, 11.0], [4.0, 5.0, 7.0] ]))
# print the first column, row-major order and elements start with 0
print(A[1,:]) 
!ec 
Numpy contains many other functionalities that allow us to slice, subdivide etc etc arrays. We strongly recommend that you look up the "Numpy website for more details":"http://www.numpy.org/". Useful functions when defining a matrix are the _np.zeros_ function which declares a matrix of a given dimension and sets all elements to zero
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to zero
A = np.zeros( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or initializing all elements to 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to one
A = np.ones( (n, n) )
print(A) 
!ec 
or as unitarily distributed random numbers (see the material on random number generators in the statistics part)
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
n = 10
# define a matrix of dimension 10 x 10 and set all elements to random numbers with x \in [0, 1]
A = np.random.rand(n, n)
print(A) 
!ec 

!split
===== More Examples, Covariance matrix =====

As we will see throughout these lectures, there are several extremely useful functionalities in Numpy.
As an example, consider the discussion of the covariance matrix. Suppose we have defined three vectors
$\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ with $n$ elements each. The covariance matrix is defined as 
!bt
\[
\hat{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\
                              \sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\
                              \sigma_{zx} & \sigma_{zy} & \sigma_{zz} 
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where for example
!bt
\[
\sigma_{xy} =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i- \overline{x})(y_i- \overline{y}).
\]
!et
The Numpy function _np.cov_ calculates the covariance elements using the factor $1/(n-1)$ instead of $1/n$ since it assumes we do not have the exact mean values. 
The following simple function uses the _np.vstack_ function which takes each vector of dimension $1\times n$ and produces a $3\times n$ matrix $\hat{W}$
!bt
\[
\hat{W} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 & y_0 & z_0 \\
                          x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
                          x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
                          \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                          x_{n-2} & y_{n-2} & z_{n-2} \\
                          x_{n-1} & y_{n-1} & z_{n-1}
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et


!split
===== More on the Covariance Matrix =====

Our matrix is in turn converted into into the $3\times 3$ covariance matrix
$\hat{\Sigma}$ via the Numpy function _np.cov()_. We note that we can also calculate
the mean value of each set of samples $\hat{x}$ etc using the Numpy
function _np.mean(x)_. We can also extract the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix through the _np.linalg.eig()_ function.

!bc pycod
# Importing various packages
import numpy as np

n = 100
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
print(np.mean(x))
y = 4+3*x+np.random.normal(size=n)
print(np.mean(y))
z = x**3+np.random.normal(size=n)
print(np.mean(z))
W = np.vstack((x, y, z))
Sigma = np.cov(W)
print(Sigma)
Eigvals, Eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(Sigma)
print(Eigvals)
!ec


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import sparse
eye = np.eye(4)
print(eye)
sparse_mtx = sparse.csr_matrix(eye)
print(sparse_mtx)
x = np.linspace(-10,10,100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x,y,marker='x')
plt.show()

===== Meet the Pandas =====


FIGURE: [fig/pandas.jpg, width=600 frac=0.8]

Another useful Python package is
"pandas":"https://pandas.pydata.org/", which is an open source library
providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data
analysis tools for Python. _pandas_ stands for panel data, a term borrowed from econometrics and is an efficient library for data analysis with an emphasis on tabular data.
_pandas_ has two major classes, the _DataFrame_ class with two-dimensional data objects and tabular data organized in columns and the class _Series_ with a focus on one-dimensional data objects. Both classes allow you to index data easily as we will see in the examples below. 
_pandas_ allows you also to perform mathematical operations on the data, spanning from simple reshapings of vectors and matrices to statistical operations. 

The following simple example shows how we can, in an easy way make tables of our data. Here we define a data set which includes names, place of birth and date of birth, and displays the data in an easy to read way. We will see repeated use of _pandas_, in particular in connection with classification of data. 

!bc pycod 
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
data = {'First Name': ["Frodo", "Bilbo", "Aragorn II", "Samwise"],
        'Last Name': ["Baggins", "Baggins","Elessar","Gamgee"],
        'Place of birth': ["Shire", "Shire", "Eriador", "Shire"],
        'Date of Birth T.A.': [2968, 2890, 2931, 2980]
        }
data_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data)
display(data_pandas)
!ec

In the above we have imported _pandas_ with the shorthand _pd_, the latter has become the standard way we import _pandas_. We make then a list of various variables
and reorganize the aboves lists into a _DataFrame_ and then print out  a neat table with specific column labels as *Name*, *place of birth* and *date of birth*.
Displaying these results, we see that the indices are given by the default numbers from zero to three.
_pandas_ is extremely flexible and we can easily change the above indices by defining a new type of indexing as
!bc pycod
data_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data,index=['Frodo','Bilbo','Aragorn','Sam'])
display(data_pandas)
!ec
Thereafter we display the content of the row which begins with the index _Aragorn_
!bc pycod
display(data_pandas.loc['Aragorn'])
!ec

We can easily append data to this, for example
!bc pycod
new_hobbit = {'First Name': ["Peregrin"],
              'Last Name': ["Took"],
              'Place of birth': ["Shire"],
              'Date of Birth T.A.': [2990]
              }
data_pandas=data_pandas.append(pd.DataFrame(new_hobbit, index=['Pippin']))
display(data_pandas)
!ec


Here are other examples where we use the _DataFrame_ functionality to handle arrays, now with more interesting features for us, namely numbers. We set up a matrix 
of dimensionality $10\times 5$ and compute the mean value and standard deviation of each column. Similarly, we can perform mathematial operations like squaring the matrix elements and many other operations. 
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display
np.random.seed(100)
# setting up a 10 x 5 matrix
rows = 10
cols = 5
a = np.random.randn(rows,cols)
df = pd.DataFrame(a)
display(df)
print(df.mean())
print(df.std())
display(df**2)
!ec

Thereafter we can select specific columns only and plot final results
!bc pycod
df.columns = ['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth', 'Fifth']
df.index = np.arange(10)

display(df)
print(df['Second'].mean() )
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

from pylab import plt, mpl
plt.style.use('seaborn')
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'

df.cumsum().plot(lw=2.0, figsize=(10,6))
plt.show()


df.plot.bar(figsize=(10,6), rot=15)
plt.show()
!ec
We can produce a $4\times 4$ matrix
!bc pycod
b = np.arange(16).reshape((4,4))
print(b)
df1 = pd.DataFrame(b)
print(df1)
!ec
and many other operations. 

The _Series_ class is another important class included in
_pandas_. You can view it as a specialization of _DataFrame_ but where
we have just a single column of data. It shares many of the same features as _DataFrame. As with _DataFrame_,
most operations are vectorized, achieving thereby a high performance when dealing with computations of arrays, in particular labeled arrays.
As we will see below it leads also to a very concice code close to the mathematical operations we may be interested in.
For multidimensional arrays, we recommend strongly "xarray":"http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/". _xarray_ has much of the same flexibility as _pandas_, but allows for the extension to higher dimensions than two. We will see examples later of the usage of both _pandas_ and _xarray_. 



===== Reading Data and fitting  =====

In order to study various Machine Learning algorithms, we need to
access data. Acccessing data is an essential step in all machine
learning algorithms. In particular, setting up the so-called _design
matrix_ (to be defined below) is often the first element we need in
order to perform our calculations. To set up the design matrix means
reading (and later, when the calculations are done, writing) data
in various formats, The formats span from reading files from disk,
loading data from databases and interacting with online sources
like web application programming interfaces (APIs).

In handling various input formats, as discussed above, we will mainly stay with _pandas_,
a Python package which allows us, in a seamless and painless way, to
deal with a multitude of formats, from standard _csv_ (comma separated
values) files, via _excel_, _html_ to _hdf5_ formats.  With _pandas_
and the _DataFrame_  and _Series_ functionalities we are able to convert text data
into the calculational formats we need for a specific algorithm. And our code is going to be 
pretty close the basic mathematical expressions.

Our first data set is going to be a classic from nuclear physics, namely all
available data on binding energies. Don't be intimidated if you are not familiar with nuclear physics. It serves simply as an example here of a data set. 

We will show some of the
strengths of packages like _Scikit-Learn_ in fitting nuclear binding energies to
specific functions using linear regression first. Then, as a teaser, we will show you how 
you can easily implement other algorithms like decision trees and random forests and neural networks.

But before we really start with nuclear physics data, let's just look at some simpler polynomial fitting cases, such as,
(don't be offended) fitting straight lines!


=== Simple linear regression model using _scikit-learn_ ===

We start with perhaps our simplest possible example, using _Scikit-Learn_ to perform linear regression analysis on a data set produced by us. 

What follows is a simple Python code where we have defined a function
$y$ in terms of the variable $x$. Both are defined as vectors with  $100$ entries. 
The numbers in the vector $\hat{x}$ are given
by random numbers generated with a uniform distribution with entries
$x_i \in [0,1]$ (more about probability distribution functions
later). These values are then used to define a function $y(x)$
(tabulated again as a vector) with a linear dependence on $x$ plus a
random noise added via the normal distribution.


The Numpy functions are imported used the _import numpy as np_
statement and the random number generator for the uniform distribution
is called using the function _np.random.rand()_, where we specificy
that we want $100$ random variables.  Using Numpy we define
automatically an array with the specified number of elements, $100$ in
our case.  With the Numpy function _randn()_ we can compute random
numbers with the normal distribution (mean value $\mu$ equal to zero and
variance $\sigma^2$ set to one) and produce the values of $y$ assuming a linear
dependence as function of $x$

!bt
\[
y = 2x+N(0,1),
\]
!et

where $N(0,1)$ represents random numbers generated by the normal
distribution.  From _Scikit-Learn_ we import then the
_LinearRegression_ functionality and make a prediction $\tilde{y} =
\alpha + \beta x$ using the function _fit(x,y)_. We call the set of
data $(\hat{x},\hat{y})$ for our training data. The Python package
_scikit-learn_ has also a functionality which extracts the above
fitting parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see below). Later we will
distinguish between training data and test data.

For plotting we use the Python package
"matplotlib":"https://matplotlib.org/" which produces publication
quality figures. Feel free to explore the extensive
"gallery":"https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html" of examples. In
this example we plot our original values of $x$ and $y$ as well as the
prediction _ypredict_ ($\tilde{y}$), which attempts at fitting our
data with a straight line.

The Python code follows here.
!bc pycod
# Importing various packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

x = np.random.rand(100,1)
y = 2*x+np.random.randn(100,1)
linreg = LinearRegression()
linreg.fit(x,y)
xnew = np.array([[0],[1]])
ypredict = linreg.predict(xnew)

plt.plot(xnew, ypredict, "r-")
plt.plot(x, y ,'ro')
plt.axis([0,1.0,0, 5.0])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$y$')
plt.title(r'Simple Linear Regression')
plt.show()
!ec

This example serves several aims. It allows us to demonstrate several
aspects of data analysis and later machine learning algorithms. The
immediate visualization shows that our linear fit is not
impressive. It goes through the data points, but there are many
outliers which are not reproduced by our linear regression.  We could
now play around with this small program and change for example the
factor in front of $x$ and the normal distribution.  Try to change the
function $y$ to

!bt
\[
y = 10x+0.01 \times N(0,1),
\]
!et

where $x$ is defined as before.  Does the fit look better? Indeed, by
reducing the role of the noise given by the normal distribution we see immediately that
our linear prediction seemingly reproduces better the training
set. However, this testing 'by the eye' is obviouly not satisfactory in the
long run. Here we have only defined the training data and our model, and 
have not discussed a more rigorous approach to the _cost_ function.

We need more rigorous criteria in defining whether we have succeeded or
not in modeling our training data.  You will be surprised to see that
many scientists seldomly venture beyond this 'by the eye' approach. A
standard approach for the *cost* function is the so-called $\chi^2$
function (a variant of the mean-squared error (MSE))

!bt 
\[ \chi^2 = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}, 
\] 
!et 

where $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance (to be defined later) of the entry
$y_i$.  We may not know the explicit value of $\sigma_i^2$, it serves
however the aim of scaling the equations and make the cost function
dimensionless.  

Minimizing the cost function is a central aspect of
our discussions to come. Finding its minima as function of the model
parameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ in our case) will be a recurring
theme in these series of lectures. Essentially all machine learning
algorithms we will discuss center around the minimization of the
chosen cost function. This depends in turn on our specific
model for describing the data, a typical situation in supervised
learning. Automatizing the search for the minima of the cost function is a
central ingredient in all algorithms. Typical methods which are
employed are various variants of _gradient_ methods. These will be
discussed in more detail later. Again, you'll be surprised to hear that
many practitioners minimize the above function ''by the eye', popularly dubbed as 
'chi by the eye'. That is, change a parameter and see (visually and numerically) that 
the  $\chi^2$ function becomes smaller. 

There are many ways to define the cost function. A simpler approach is to look at the relative difference between the training data and the predicted data, that is we define 
the relative error (why would we prefer the MSE instead of the relative error?) as

!bt
\[
\epsilon_{\mathrm{relative}}= \frac{\vert \hat{y} -\hat{\tilde{y}}\vert}{\vert \hat{y}\vert}.
\]
!et

The squared cost function results in an arithmetic mean-unbiased
estimator, and the absolute-value cost function results in a
median-unbiased estimator (in the one-dimensional case, and a
geometric median-unbiased estimator for the multi-dimensional
case). The squared cost function has the disadvantage that it has the tendency
to be dominated by outliers.

We can modify easily the above Python code and plot the relative error instead
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

x = np.random.rand(100,1)
y = 5*x+0.01*np.random.randn(100,1)
linreg = LinearRegression()
linreg.fit(x,y)
ypredict = linreg.predict(x)

plt.plot(x, np.abs(ypredict-y)/abs(y), "ro")
plt.axis([0,1.0,0.0, 0.5])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$\epsilon_{\mathrm{relative}}$')
plt.title(r'Relative error')
plt.show()
!ec

Depending on the parameter in front of the normal distribution, we may
have a small or larger relative error. Try to play around with
different training data sets and study (graphically) the value of the
relative error.

As mentioned above, _Scikit-Learn_ has an impressive functionality.
We can for example extract the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and
their error estimates, or the variance and standard deviation and many
other properties from the statistical data analysis. 

Here we show an
example of the functionality of _Scikit-Learn_.
!bc pycod 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_squared_log_error, mean_absolute_error

x = np.random.rand(100,1)
y = 2.0+ 5*x+0.5*np.random.randn(100,1)
linreg = LinearRegression()
linreg.fit(x,y)
ypredict = linreg.predict(x)
print('The intercept alpha: \n', linreg.intercept_)
print('Coefficient beta : \n', linreg.coef_)
# The mean squared error                               
print("Mean squared error: %.2f" % mean_squared_error(y, ypredict))
# Explained variance score: 1 is perfect prediction                                 
print('Variance score: %.2f' % r2_score(y, ypredict))
# Mean squared log error                                                        
print('Mean squared log error: %.2f' % mean_squared_log_error(y, ypredict) )
# Mean absolute error                                                           
print('Mean absolute error: %.2f' % mean_absolute_error(y, ypredict))
plt.plot(x, ypredict, "r-")
plt.plot(x, y ,'ro')
plt.axis([0.0,1.0,1.5, 7.0])
plt.xlabel(r'$x$')
plt.ylabel(r'$y$')
plt.title(r'Linear Regression fit ')
plt.show()

!ec
The function _coef_ gives us the parameter $\beta$ of our fit while _intercept_ yields 
$\alpha$. Depending on the constant in front of the normal distribution, we get values near or far from $alpha =2$ and $\beta =5$. Try to play around with different parameters in front of the normal distribution. The function _meansquarederror_ gives us the mean square error, a risk metric corresponding to the expected value of the squared (quadratic) error or loss defined as
!bt 
\[ MSE(\hat{y},\hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2, 
\] 
!et 

The smaller the value, the better the fit. Ideally we would like to
have an MSE equal zero.  The attentive reader has probably recognized
this function as being similar to the $\chi^2$ function defined above.

The _r2score_ function computes $R^2$, the coefficient of
determination. It provides a measure of how well future samples are
likely to be predicted by the model. Best possible score is 1.0 and it
can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A
constant model that always predicts the expected value of $\hat{y}$,
disregarding the input features, would get a $R^2$ score of $0.0$.

If $\tilde{\hat{y}}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i-th$ sample and $y_i$ is the corresponding true value, then the score $R^2$ is defined as
!bt
\[
R^2(\hat{y}, \tilde{\hat{y}}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \tilde{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2},
\]
!et
where we have defined the mean value  of $\hat{y}$ as
!bt
\[
\bar{y} =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} y_i.
\]
!et
Another quantity taht we will meet again in our discussions of regression analysis is 
 the mean absolute error (MAE), a risk metric corresponding to the expected value of the absolute error loss or what we call the $l1$-norm loss. In our discussion above we presented the relative error.
The MAE is defined as follows
!bt
\[
\text{MAE}(\hat{y}, \hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left| y_i - \tilde{y}_i \right|.
\]
!et
We present the 
squared logarithmic (quadratic) error
!bt
\[
\text{MSLE}(\hat{y}, \hat{\tilde{y}}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (\log_e (1 + y_i) - \log_e (1 + \tilde{y}_i) )^2,
\]
!et

where $\log_e (x)$ stands for the natural logarithm of $x$. This error
estimate is best to use when targets having exponential growth, such
as population counts, average sales of a commodity over a span of
years etc. 


Finally, another cost function is the Huber cost function used in robust regression.

The rationale behind this possible cost function is its reduced
sensitivity to outliers in the data set. In our discussions on
dimensionality reduction and normalization of data we will meet other
ways of dealing with outliers.

The Huber cost function is defined as
!bt
\[
H_{\delta}(a)={\begin{cases}{\frac {1}{2}}{a^{2}}&{\text{for }}|a|\leq \delta ,\\\delta (|a|-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta ),&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}}.
\]
!et
Here $a=\bm{y} - \bm{\tilde{y}}$.
We will discuss in more
detail these and other functions in the various lectures.  We conclude this part with another example. Instead of 
a linear $x$-dependence we study now a cubic polynomial and use the polynomial regression analysis tools of scikit-learn. 

!bc pycod

=== To our real data: nuclear binding energies. Brief reminder on masses and binding energies ===

Let us now dive into  nuclear physics and remind ourselves briefly about some basic features about binding
energies.  A basic quantity which can be measured for the ground
states of nuclei is the atomic mass $M(N, Z)$ of the neutral atom with
atomic mass number $A$ and charge $Z$. The number of neutrons is $N$. There are indeed several sophisticated experiments worldwide which allow us to measure this quantity to high precision (parts per million even). 

Atomic masses are usually tabulated in terms of the mass excess defined by
!bt
\[
\Delta M(N, Z) =  M(N, Z) - uA,
\]
!et
where $u$ is the Atomic Mass Unit 
!bt
\[
u = M(^{12}\mathrm{C})/12 = 931.4940954(57) \hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2.
\]
!et
The nucleon masses are
!bt 
\[
m_p =  1.00727646693(9)u,
\] 
!et
and
!bt 
\[
m_n = 939.56536(8)\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2 = 1.0086649156(6)u.
\]
!et

In the "2016 mass evaluation of by W.J.Huang, G.Audi, M.Wang, F.G.Kondev, S.Naimi and X.Xu":"http://nuclearmasses.org/resources_folder/Wang_2017_Chinese_Phys_C_41_030003.pdf"
there are data on masses and decays of 3437 nuclei.

The nuclear binding energy is defined as the energy required to break
up a given nucleus into its constituent parts of $N$ neutrons and $Z$
protons. In terms of the atomic masses $M(N, Z)$ the binding energy is
defined by


!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = ZM_H c^2 + Nm_n c^2 - M(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $M_H$ is the mass of the hydrogen atom and $m_n$ is the mass of the neutron.
In terms of the mass excess the binding energy is given by
!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = Z\Delta_H c^2 + N\Delta_n c^2 -\Delta(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $\Delta_H c^2 = 7.2890$ MeV and $\Delta_n c^2 = 8.0713$ MeV.


A popular and physically intuitive model which can be used to parametrize 
the experimental binding energies as function of $A$, is the so-called 
_liquid drop model_. The ansatz is based on the following expression

!bt
\[ 
BE(N,Z) = a_1A-a_2A^{2/3}-a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}-a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A},
\]
!et

where $A$ stands for the number of nucleons and the $a_i$s are parameters which are determined by a fit 
to the experimental data.  




To arrive at the above expression we have assumed that we can make the following assumptions:

 * There is a volume term $a_1A$ proportional with the number of nucleons (the energy is also an extensive quantity). When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.

 * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.


 * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. 

 * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflects the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.

We could also add a so-called pairing term, which is a correction term that
arises from the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to
occur. An even number of particles is more stable than an odd number. 


=== Organizing our data ===

Let us start with reading and organizing our data. 
We start with the compilation of masses and binding energies from 2016.
After having downloaded this file to our own computer, we are now ready to read the file and start structuring our data.


We start with preparing folders for storing our calculations and the data file over masses and binding energies. We import also various modules that we will find useful in order to present various Machine Learning methods. Here we focus mainly on the functionality of _scikit-learn_.
!bc pycod
# Common imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn.linear_model as skl
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, mean_absolute_error
import os

# Where to save the figures and data files
PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = "Results"
FIGURE_ID = "Results/FigureFiles"
DATA_ID = "DataFiles/"

if not os.path.exists(PROJECT_ROOT_DIR):
    os.mkdir(PROJECT_ROOT_DIR)

if not os.path.exists(FIGURE_ID):
    os.makedirs(FIGURE_ID)

if not os.path.exists(DATA_ID):
    os.makedirs(DATA_ID)

def image_path(fig_id):
    return os.path.join(FIGURE_ID, fig_id)

def data_path(dat_id):
    return os.path.join(DATA_ID, dat_id)

def save_fig(fig_id):
    plt.savefig(image_path(fig_id) + ".png", format='png')

infile = open(data_path("MassEval2016.dat"),'r')
!ec


Before we proceed, we define also a function for making our plots. You can obviously avoid this and simply set up various _matplotlib_ commands every time you need them. You may however find it convenient to collect all such commands in one function and simply call this function. 
!bc pycod 
from pylab import plt, mpl
plt.style.use('seaborn')
mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'

def MakePlot(x,y, styles, labels, axlabels):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    for i in range(len(x)):
        plt.plot(x[i], y[i], styles[i], label = labels[i])
        plt.xlabel(axlabels[0])
        plt.ylabel(axlabels[1])
    plt.legend(loc=0)
!ec

Our next step is to read the data on experimental binding energies and
reorganize them as functions of the mass number $A$, the number of
protons $Z$ and neutrons $N$ using _pandas_.  Before we do this it is
always useful (unless you have a binary file or other types of compressed
data) to actually open the file and simply take a look at it!


In particular, the program that outputs the final nuclear masses is written in Fortran with a specific format. It means that we need to figure out the format and which columns contain the data we are interested in. Pandas comes with a function that reads formatted output. After having admired the file, we are now ready to start massaging it with _pandas_. The file begins with some basic format information.
!bc pycod 
"""                                                                                                                         
This is taken from the data file of the mass 2016 evaluation.

   These formats are reflected in the pandas widths variable below, see the statement

   Pandas has also a variable header, with length 39 in this case.

!ec

The data we are interested in are in columns 2, 3, 4 and 11, giving us
the number of neutrons, protons, mass numbers and binding energies,
respectively. We add also for the sake of completeness the element name. The data are in fixed-width formatted lines and we will
covert them into the _pandas_ DataFrame structure.

!bc pycod 
# Read the experimental data with Pandas
Masses = pd.read_fwf(infile, usecols=(2,3,4,6,11),
              names=('N', 'Z', 'A', 'Element', 'Ebinding'),
              widths=(1,3,5,5,5,1,3,4,1,13,11,11,9,1,2,11,9,1,3,1,12,11,1),

              index_col=False)

# Extrapolated values are indicated by '#' in place of the decimal place, so
# the Ebinding column won't be numeric. Coerce to float and drop these entries.
Masses['Ebinding'] = pd.to_numeric(Masses['Ebinding'], errors='coerce')
Masses = Masses.dropna()
# Convert from keV to MeV.
Masses['Ebinding'] /= 1000

# Group the DataFrame by nucleon number, A.
Masses = Masses.groupby('A')
# Find the rows of the grouped DataFrame with the maximum binding energy.
Masses = Masses.apply(lambda t: t[t.Ebinding==t.Ebinding.max()])
!ec

We have now read in the data, grouped them according to the variables we are interested in. 
We see how easy it is to reorganize the data using _pandas_. If we
were to do these operations in C/C++ or Fortran, we would have had to
write various functions/subroutines which perform the above
reorganizations for us.  Having reorganized the data, we can now start
to make some simple fits using both the functionalities in _numpy_ and
_Scikit-Learn_ afterwards. 

Now we define five variables which contain
the number of nucleons $A$, the number of protons $Z$ and the number of neutrons $N$, the element name and finally the energies themselves.
!bc pycod

The next step, and we will define this mathematically later, is to set up the so-called _design matrix_. We will throughout call this matrix $\bm{X}$.
It has dimensionality $p\times n$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $p$ are the so-called predictors. In our case here they are given by the number of polynomials in $A$ we wish to include in the fit. 
!bc pycod
# Now we set up the design matrix X
X = np.zeros((len(A),5))
X[:,0] = 1
X[:,1] = A
X[:,2] = A**(2.0/3.0)
X[:,3] = A**(-1.0/3.0)
X[:,4] = A**(-1.0)
!ec
With _scikitlearn_ we are now ready to use linear regression and fit our data.
!bc pycod 
clf = skl.LinearRegression().fit(X, Energies)
fity = clf.predict(X)
!ec
Pretty simple!  
Now we can print measures of how our fit is doing, the coefficients from the fits and plot the final fit together with our data.

functionality.

=== More on flexibility with pandas and xarray ===

Let us study the $Q$ values associated with the removal of one or two nucleons from
a nucleus. These are conventionally defined in terms of the one-nucleon and two-nucleon
separation energies. With the functionality in _pandas_, two to three lines of code will allow us to plot the separation energies.
The neutron separation energy is defined as 

!bt
\[
S_n= -Q_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z),
\]
!et
and the proton separation energy reads
!bt
\[
S_p= -Q_p= BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-1).
\]
!et
The two-neutron separation energy is defined as
!bt
\[
S_{2n}= -Q_{2n}= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-2,Z),
\]
!et
and  the two-proton separation energy is given by
!bt
\[
S_{2p}= -Q_{2p}= BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-2).
\]
!et

Using say the neutron separation energies (alternatively the proton separation energies)
!bt
\[
S_n= -Q_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z),
\]
!et
we can define the so-called energy gap for neutrons (or protons) as 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-\left(BE(N+1,Z)-BE(N,Z)\right),
\]
!et
or 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-BE(N+1,Z).
\]
!et
This quantity can in turn be used to determine which nuclei could be interpreted as  magic or not. 
For protons we would have 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_p= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-1)-BE(N,Z+1).
\]
!et

To calculate say the neutron separation we need to multiply our masses with the nucleon number $A$ (why?).
Thereafter we pick the oxygen isotopes and simply compute the separation energies with  two lines of code (note that most of the code here is a repeat of what you have seen before).

===== Why Linear Regression (aka Ordinary Least Squares and family) =====

Fitting a continuous function with linear parameterization in terms of the parameters  $\bm{\beta}$.
* Method of choice for fitting a continuous function!
* Gives an excellent introduction to central Machine Learning features with _understandable pedagogical_ links to other methods like _Neural Networks_, _Support Vector Machines_ etc
* Analytical expression for the fitting parameters $\bm{\beta}$
* Analytical expressions for statistical propertiers like mean values, variances, confidence intervals and more
* Analytical relation with probabilistic interpretations 
* Easy to introduce basic concepts like bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, resampling and regularization techniques and many other ML topics
* Easy to code! And links well with classification problems and logistic regression and neural networks
* Allows for _easy_ hands-on understanding of gradient descent methods
* and many more features

For more discussions of Ridge and Lasso regression, "Wessel van Wieringen's":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09169" article is highly recommended.
Similarly, "Mehta et al's article":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823" is also recommended.

===== Regression analysis, overarching aims  =====
!bblock

Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ and how it varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\bm{x} =[x_0, x_1,\dots, x_{n-1}]^T$. 
The first variable is called the _dependent_, the _outcome_ or the _response_ variable while the set of variables $\bm{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. 
 
A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(\bm{y}\vert \bm{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $\bm{y}$ with a given $\bm{x}$. The estimation of  $p(\bm{y}\vert \bm{x})$ is made using a data set with 
* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ 
* $p$ so-called explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\bm{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip-1}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1$ and explanatory variables running from $0$ to $p-1$. See below for more explicit examples.   
 The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{x}$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.

===== Regression analysis, overarching aims II =====
!bblock


Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are
measured. The data from this experiment, for various explanatory variables $p$ are normally represented by a matrix  
$\mathbf{X}$.

The matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design
matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the
form of $\bm{y}$ (also as above). The variable $\bm{y}$ is
generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of
regression analysis is to explain $\bm{y}$ in terms of
$\bm{X}$ through a functional relationship like $y_i =
f(\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of
$f(\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship
between $\bm{X}$ and $\bm{y}$. This assumption gives rise to
the *linear regression model* where $\bm{\beta} = [\beta_0, \ldots,
\beta_{p-1}]^{T}$ are the *regression parameters*. 

Linear regression gives us a set of analytical equations for the parameters $\beta_j$.

!split
=====  Examples  =====
!bblock
In order to understand the relation among the predictors $p$, the set of data $n$ and the target (outcome, output etc) $\bm{y}$,
consider the model we discussed for describing nuclear binding energies. 

There we assumed that we could parametrize the data using a polynomial approximation based on the liquid drop model.
Assuming 
!bt
\[
BE(A) = a_0+a_1A+a_2A^{2/3}+a_3A^{-1/3}+a_4A^{-1},
\]
!et
we have five predictors, that is the intercept, the $A$ dependent term, the $A^{2/3}$ term and the $A^{-1/3}$ and $A^{-1}$ terms.
This gives $p=0,1,2,3,4$. Furthermore we have $n$ entries for each predictor. It means that our design matrix is a 
$p\times n$ matrix $\bm{X}$.

Here the predictors are based on a model we have made. A popular data set which is widely encountered in ML applications is the
so-called "credit card default data from Taiwan":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719?via%3Dihub". The data set contains data on $n=30000$ credit card holders with predictors like gender, marital status, age, profession, education, etc. In total there are $24$ such predictors or attributes leading to a design matrix of dimensionality $24 \times 30000$. This is however a classification problem and we will come back to it when we discuss Logistic Regression.

!split
===== General linear models  =====
!bblock
Before we proceed let us study a case from linear algebra where we aim at fitting a set of data $\bm{y}=[y_0,y_1,\dots,y_{n-1}]$. We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\bm{x}=[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. 

Since obtaining these data points may not be trivial, we want to use these data to fit a function which can allow us to make predictions for values of $y$ which are not in the present set. The perhaps simplest approach is to assume we can parametrize our function in terms of a polynomial of degree $n-1$ with $n$ points, that is
!bt
\[
y=y(x) \rightarrow y(x_i)=\tilde{y}_i+\epsilon_i=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \beta_j x_i^j+\epsilon_i,
\]
!et
where $\epsilon_i$ is the error in our approximation.

We are obviously not limited to the above polynomial expansions.  We
could replace the various powers of $x$ with elements of Fourier
series or instead of $x_i^j$ we could have $\cos{(j x_i)}$ or $\sin{(j
x_i)}$, or time series or other orthogonal functions.  For every set
of values $y_i,x_i$ we can then generalize the equations to

!bt
\begin{align*}
y_0&=\beta_0x_{00}+\beta_1x_{01}+\beta_2x_{02}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{0n-1}+\epsilon_0\\

As we noted above, we stayed with a system with the design matrix 
 $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n\times n}$, that is we have $p=n$. For reasons to come later (algorithmic arguments) we will hereafter define

!et
or using the matrix $\bm{X}$ and in a more compact matrix-vector notation as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}^T\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}^T\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}.

This function is one possible way to define the so-called cost function.



It is also common to define
the function $Q$ as

!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2,
\]
!et
since when taking the first derivative with respect to the unknown parameters $\beta$, the factor of $2$ cancels out.

The function 
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
can be linked to the variance of the quantity $y_i$ if we interpret the latter as the mean value. 
When linking (see the discussion below) with the maximum likelihood approach below, we will indeed interpret $y_i$ as a mean value
!bt
\[
y_{i}=\langle y_i \rangle = \beta_0x_{i,0}+\beta_1x_{i,1}+\beta_2x_{i,2}+\dots+\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}+\epsilon_i,
\]
!et

where $\langle y_i \rangle$ is the mean value. Keep in mind also that
till now we have treated $y_i$ as the exact value. Normally, the
response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ the outcome of a
numerical experiment or another type of experiment and is thus only an
approximation to the true value. It is then always accompanied by an
error estimate, often limited to a statistical error estimate given by
the standard deviation discussed earlier. In the discussion here we
will treat $y_i$ as our exact value for the response variable.

In order to find the parameters $\beta_i$ we will then minimize the spread of $C(\bm{\beta})$, that is we are going to solve the problem
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
In practical terms it means we will require
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta_j}\left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}\right)^2\right]=0, 
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = -\frac{2}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_{ij}\left(y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}\right)\right]=0, 
\]
!et
or in a matrix-vector form as
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = 0 = \bm{X}^T\left( \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right).  
\]
!et


!eblock


!split
===== Interpretations and optimizing our parameters  =====
!bblock
We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = 0 = \bm{X}^T\left( \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right),  
\]
!et
as
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\beta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is invertible we have the solution
!bt
\[
\bm{\beta} =\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

We note also that since our design matrix is defined as $\bm{X}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{n\times p}$, the product $\bm{X}^T\bm{X} \in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p\times p}$.  In the above case we have that $p \ll n$,
in our case $p=5$ meaning that we end up with inverting a small
$5\times 5$ matrix. This is a rather common situation, in many cases we end up with low-dimensional
matrices to invert. The methods discussed here and for many other
supervised learning algorithms like classification with logistic
regression or support vector machines, exhibit dimensionalities which
allow for the usage of direct linear algebra methods such as _LU_ decomposition or _Singular Value Decomposition_ (SVD) for finding the inverse of the matrix
$\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. 
!eblock

_Small question_: Do you think the example we have at hand here (the nuclear binding energies) can lead to problems in inverting the matrix  $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$? What kind of problems can we expect?

===== Some useful matrix and vector expressions =====

The following matrix and vector relation will be useful here and for the rest of the course. Vectors are always written as boldfaced lower case letters and 
matrices as upper case boldfaced letters. 

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial (\bm{b}^T\bm{a})}{\partial \bm{a}} = \bm{b},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial (\bm{a}^T\bm{A}\bm{a})}{\partial \bm{a}} = (\bm{A}+\bm{A}^T)\bm{a},

\[
\frac{\partial tr(\bm{B}\bm{A})}{\partial \bm{A}} = \bm{B}^T,

\]
!et

===== Interpretations and optimizing our parameters  =====
!bblock
The residuals $\bm{\epsilon}$ are in turn given by
!bt
\[
\bm{\epsilon} = \bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta},
\]
!et
and with 
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\left( \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)= 0, 
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{\epsilon}=\bm{X}^T\left( \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)= 0, 
\]
!et
meaning that the solution for $\bm{\beta}$ is the one which minimizes the residuals.  Later we will link this with the maximum likelihood approach.

!eblock


Let us now return to our nuclear binding energies and simply code the above equations. 

!split
===== Own code for Ordinary Least Squares =====

It is rather straightforward to implement the matrix inversion and obtain the parameters $\bm{\beta}$. After having defined the matrix $\bm{X}$ we simply need to 
write
!bc pycod 
# matrix inversion to find beta
beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(Energies)
# and then make the prediction
ytilde = X @ beta
!ec
Alternatively, you can use the least squares functionality in _Numpy_ as
!bc pycod 
fit = np.linalg.lstsq(X, Energies, rcond =None)[0]
ytildenp = np.dot(fit,X.T)
!ec

And finally we plot our fit with and compare with data
!bc pycod
Masses['Eapprox']  = ytilde
# Generate a plot comparing the experimental with the fitted values values.
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xlabel(r'$A = N + Z$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'$E_\mathrm{bind}\,/\mathrm{MeV}$')
ax.plot(Masses['A'], Masses['Ebinding'], alpha=0.7, lw=2,
            label='Ame2016')
ax.plot(Masses['A'], Masses['Eapprox'], alpha=0.7, lw=2, c='m',
            label='Fit')
ax.legend()
save_fig("Masses2016OLS")
plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== Adding error analysis and training set up =====

We can easily test our fit by computing the $R2$ score that we discussed in connection with the functionality of _Scikit_Learn_ in the introductory slides.
Since we are not using _Scikit-Learn here we can define our own $R2$ function as
!bc pycod 
def R2(y_data, y_model):
    return 1 - np.sum((y_data - y_model) ** 2) / np.sum((y_data - np.mean(y_data)) ** 2)
!ec
and we would be using it as 
!bc pycod 
print(R2(Energies,ytilde))
!ec

We can easily add our _MSE_ score as
!bc pycod
def MSE(y_data,y_model):
    n = np.size(y_model)
    return np.sum((y_data-y_model)**2)/n

print(MSE(Energies,ytilde))
!ec
and finally the relative error as
!bc pycod
def RelativeError(y_data,y_model):
    return abs((y_data-y_model)/y_data)
print(RelativeError(Energies, ytilde))
!ec


We could also add the so-called Huber norm, which we defined as
!bt
\[
H_{\delta}(a)={\begin{cases}{\frac {1}{2}}{a^{2}}&{\text{for }}|a|\leq \delta ,\\\delta (|a|-{\frac {1}{2}}\delta ),&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}},
\]
!et
with $a=\bm{y} - \bm{\tilde{y}}$.


!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

Normally, the response (dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ is the
outcome of a numerical experiment or another type of experiment and is
thus only an approximation to the true value. It is then always
accompanied by an error estimate, often limited to a statistical error
estimate given by the standard deviation discussed earlier. In the
discussion here we will treat $y_i$ as our exact value for the
response variable.

Introducing the standard deviation $\sigma_i$ for each measurement
$y_i$, we define now the $\chi^2$ function (omitting the $1/n$ term)
as

!bt
\[
\chi^2(\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2}{\sigma_i^2}=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\frac{1}{\bm{\Sigma^2}}\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
where the matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix with $\sigma_i$ as matrix elements. 

!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

In order to find the parameters $\beta_i$ we will then minimize the spread of $\chi^2(\bm{\beta})$ by requiring
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta_j}\left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}}{\sigma_i}\right)^2\right]=0, 
\]
!et
which results in
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_j} = -\frac{2}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_{ij}}{\sigma_i}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0x_{i,0}-\beta_1x_{i,1}-\beta_2x_{i,2}-\dots-\beta_{n-1}x_{i,n-1}}{\sigma_i}\right)\right]=0, 
\]
!et
or in a matrix-vector form as
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = 0 = \bm{A}^T\left( \bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{\beta}\right).  
\]
!et
where we have defined the matrix $\bm{A} =\bm{X}/\bm{\Sigma}$ with matrix elements $a_{ij} = x_{ij}/\sigma_i$ and the vector $\bm{b}$ with elements $b_i = y_i/\sigma_i$.   
!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

We can rewrite
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = 0 = \bm{A}^T\left( \bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{\beta}\right),  
\]
!et
as
!bt
\[
\bm{A}^T\bm{b} = \bm{A}^T\bm{A}\bm{\beta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{A}^T\bm{A}$ is invertible we have the solution
!bt
\[
\bm{\beta} =\left(\bm{A}^T\bm{A}\right)^{-1}\bm{A}^T\bm{b}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====
!bblock

If we then introduce the matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{H} =  \left(\bm{A}^T\bm{A}\right)^{-1},
\]
!et
we have then the following expression for the parameters $\beta_j$ (the matrix elements of $\bm{H}$ are $h_{ij}$)
!bt
\[
\beta_j = \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{y_i}{\sigma_i}\frac{x_{ik}}{\sigma_i} = \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}b_ia_{ik}
\]
!et
We state without proof the expression for the uncertainty  in the parameters $\beta_j$ as (we leave this as an exercise)
!bt
\[
\sigma^2(\beta_j) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma_i^2\left( \frac{\partial \beta_j}{\partial y_i}\right)^2, 
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
\sigma^2(\beta_j) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}h_{jk}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_{ik}\right)\left(\sum_{l=0}^{p-1}h_{jl}\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}a_{ml}\right) = h_{jj}!
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====

The first step here is to approximate the function $y$ with a first-order polynomial, that is we write
!bt
\[
y=y(x) \rightarrow y(x_i) \approx \beta_0+\beta_1 x_i.
\]
!et
By computing the derivatives of $\chi^2$ with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ show that these are given by
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -2\left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\right]=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \chi^2(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_1} = -\frac{2}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2}\right)\right]=0.

===== The $\chi^2$ function  =====

For a linear fit (a first-order polynomial) we don't need to invert a matrix!!  
Defining

\[
\gamma =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2},

!et

!bt
\[
\gamma_x =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},
\]

!bt
\[
\gamma_y = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{y_i}{\sigma_i^2}\right),
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\gamma_{xx} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{x_ix_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\gamma_{xy} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{y_ix_{i}}{\sigma_i^2},
\]
!et

we obtain

!bt
\[
\beta_0 = \frac{\gamma_{xx}\gamma_y-\gamma_x\gamma_y}{\gamma\gamma_{xx}-\gamma_x^2},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\beta_1 = \frac{\gamma_{xy}\gamma-\gamma_x\gamma_y}{\gamma\gamma_{xx}-\gamma_x^2}.
\]
!et

This approach (different linear and non-linear regression) suffers
often from both being underdetermined and overdetermined in the
unknown coefficients $\beta_i$.  A better approach is to use the
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method discussed below. Or using
Lasso and Ridge regression. See below.

===== Fitting an Equation of State for Dense Nuclear Matter =====

Before we continue, let us introduce yet another example. We are going to fit the
nuclear equation of state using results from many-body calculations.
The equation of state we have made available here, as function of
density, has been derived using modern nucleon-nucleon potentials with
"the addition of three-body
forces":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157399001106". This
time the file is presented as a standard _csv_ file.

The beginning of the Python code here is similar to what you have seen
before, with the same initializations and declarations. We use also
_pandas_ again, rather extensively in order to organize our data.

The difference now is that we use _Scikit-Learn's_ regression tools
instead of our own matrix inversion implementation. Furthermore, we
sneak in _Ridge_ regression (to be discussed below) which includes a
hyperparameter $\lambda$, also to be explained below.

The above simple polynomial in density $\rho$ gives an excellent fit
to the data.

standard OLS and the Ridge regression at higher densities. We discuss this in more detail

===== Splitting our Data in Training and Test data =====

It is normal in essentially all Machine Learning studies to split the
data in a training set and a test set (sometimes also an additional
validation set).  _Scikit-Learn_ has an own function for this. There
is no explicit recipe for how much data should be included as training
data and say test data.  An accepted rule of thumb is to use
approximately $2/3$ to $4/5$ of the data as training data. We will
postpone a discussion of this splitting to the end of these notes and
our discussion of the so-called _bias-variance_ tradeoff. Here we
limit ourselves to repeat the above equation of state fitting example
but now splitting the data into a training set and a test set.

===== The Boston housing data example =====

The Boston housing  
data set was originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository
and has been removed now. The data set is now included in _Scikit-Learn_'s 
library.  There are 506 samples and 13 feature (predictor) variables
in this data set. The objective is to predict the value of prices of
the house using the features (predictors) listed here.

The features/predictors are
 o CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
 o ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25000 square feet
 o INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
 o CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
 o NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
 o RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
 o AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
 o DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
 o RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
 o TAX: Full-value property tax rate per USD10000
 o B: $1000(Bk - 0.63)^2$, where $Bk$ is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town
 o LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population
 o MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in USD 1000s

!bc pycod
boston = pd.DataFrame(boston_dataset.data, columns=boston_dataset.feature_names)
boston.head()
boston['MEDV'] = boston_dataset.target
!ec
and preprocess the data
!bc pycod
# check for missing values in all the columns
boston.isnull().sum()
!ec
We can then visualize the data
!bc pycod
# set the size of the figure
sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(11.7,8.27)})

# plot a histogram showing the distribution of the target values
sns.distplot(boston['MEDV'], bins=30)
plt.show()
!ec

It is now useful to look at the correlation matrix
!bc pycod
# compute the pair wise correlation for all columns  
correlation_matrix = boston.corr().round(2)
# use the heatmap function from seaborn to plot the correlation matrix
# annot = True to print the values inside the square
sns.heatmap(data=correlation_matrix, annot=True)
!ec
From the above coorelation plot we can see that _MEDV_ is strongly correlated to _LSTAT_ and  _RM_. We see also that _RAD_ and _TAX_ are stronly correlated, but we don't include this in our features together to avoid multi-colinearity

!bc pycod
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))

features = ['LSTAT', 'RM']
target = boston['MEDV']

for i, col in enumerate(features):
    plt.subplot(1, len(features) , i+1)
    x = boston[col]
    y = target
    plt.scatter(x, y, marker='o')
    plt.title(col)
    plt.xlabel(col)
    plt.ylabel('MEDV')
!ec
Now we start training our model
!bc pycod
X = pd.DataFrame(np.c_[boston['LSTAT'], boston['RM']], columns = ['LSTAT','RM'])
Y = boston['MEDV']
!ec
We split the data into training and test sets

!bc pycod
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# splits the training and test data set in 80% : 20%
# assign random_state to any value.This ensures consistency.
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=5)
print(X_train.shape)
print(X_test.shape)
print(Y_train.shape)
print(Y_test.shape)
!ec
Then we use the linear regression functionality from _Scikit-Learn_
!bc pycod
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

lin_model = LinearRegression()
lin_model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# model evaluation for training set

y_train_predict = lin_model.predict(X_train)
rmse = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_train, y_train_predict)))
r2 = r2_score(Y_train, y_train_predict)

print("The model performance for training set")
print("--------------------------------------")
print('RMSE is {}'.format(rmse))
print('R2 score is {}'.format(r2))
print("\n")

# model evaluation for testing set

y_test_predict = lin_model.predict(X_test)
# root mean square error of the model
rmse = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_test, y_test_predict)))

# r-squared score of the model
r2 = r2_score(Y_test, y_test_predict)

print("The model performance for testing set")
print("--------------------------------------")
print('RMSE is {}'.format(rmse))
print('R2 score is {}'.format(r2))
!ec

!bc pycod
# plotting the y_test vs y_pred
# ideally should have been a straight line
plt.scatter(Y_test, y_test_predict)

===== The singular value decomposition  =====

!bblock

The examples we have looked at so far are cases where we normally can
invert the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. Using a polynomial expansion as we
did both for the masses and the fitting of the equation of state,
leads to row vectors of the design matrix which are essentially
orthogonal due to the polynomial character of our model. Obtaining the inverse of the design matrix is then often done via a so-called LU, QR or Cholesky decomposition. 



This may
however not the be case in general and a standard matrix inversion
algorithm based on say LU, QR or Cholesky decomposition may lead to singularities. We will see examples of this below.

There is however a way to partially circumvent this problem and also gain some insight about the ordinary least squares approach. 

This is given by the _Singular Value Decomposition_ algorithm, perhaps
the most powerful linear algebra algorithm.  Let us look at a
different example where we may have problems with the standard matrix
inversion algorithm. Thereafter we dive into the math of the SVD.

!eblock



!split
===== Linear Regression Problems =====

One of the typical problems we encounter with linear regression, in particular 
when the matrix $\bm{X}$ (our so-called design matrix) is high-dimensional, 
are problems with near singular or singular matrices. The column vectors of $\bm{X}$ 
may be linearly dependent, normally referred to as super-collinearity.  
This means that the matrix may be rank deficient and it is basically impossible to 
to model the data using linear regression. As an example, consider the matrix
!bt
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{X} & =  \left[
\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & -1 & 2
\\
1 & 0 & 1
\\
1 & 2  & -1
\\
1 & 1  & 0
\end{array} \right]
\end{align*}
!et

The columns of $\bm{X}$ are linearly dependent. We see this easily since the 
the first column is the row-wise sum of the other two columns. The rank (more correct,
the column rank) of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by the
column vectors. Hence, the rank of $\mathbf{X}$ is equal to the number
of linearly independent columns. In this particular case the matrix has rank 2.

Super-collinearity of an $(n \times p)$-dimensional design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ implies
that the inverse of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ (the matrix we need to invert to solve the linear regression equations) is non-invertible. If we have a square matrix that does not have an inverse, we say this matrix singular. The example here demonstrates this
!bt
\begin{align*}
\bm{X} & =  \left[
\begin{array}{rr}
1 & -1
\\
1 & -1
\end{array} \right].
\end{align*}
!et
We see easily that  $\mbox{det}(\bm{X}) = x_{11} x_{22} - x_{12} x_{21} = 1 \times (-1) - 1 \times (-1) = 0$. Hence, $\mathbf{X}$ is singular and its inverse is undefined.
This is equivalent to saying that the matrix $\bm{X}$ has at least an eigenvalue which is zero.


!split
===== Fixing the singularity =====

If our design matrix $\bm{X}$ which enters the linear regression problem
!bt
\begin{align}
\bm{\beta} & =  (\bm{X}^{T} \bm{X})^{-1} \bm{X}^{T} \bm{y},
\end{align}
!et
has linearly dependent column vectors, we will not be able to compute the inverse
of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ and we cannot find the parameters (estimators) $\beta_i$. 
The estimators are only well-defined if $(\bm{X}^{T}\bm{X})^{-1}$ exits. 
This is more likely to happen when the matrix $\bm{X}$ is high-dimensional. In this case it is likely to encounter a situation where 
the regression parameters $\beta_i$ cannot be estimated.

A cheap  *ad hoc* approach is  simply to add a small diagonal component to the matrix to invert, that is we change
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^{T} \bm{X} \rightarrow \bm{X}^{T} \bm{X}+\lambda \bm{I},
\]
!et 
where $\bm{I}$ is the identity matrix.  When we discuss _Ridge_ regression this is actually what we end up evaluating. The parameter $\lambda$ is called a hyperparameter. More about this later. 



!split
===== Basic math of the SVD =====


From standard linear algebra we know that a square matrix $\bm{X}$ can be diagonalized if and only it is 
a so-called "normal matrix":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_matrix", that is if $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n\times n}$
we have $\bm{X}\bm{X}^T=\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ or if $\bm{X}\in {\mathbb{C}}^{n\times n}$ we have $\bm{X}\bm{X}^{\dagger}=\bm{X}^{\dagger}\bm{X}$.
The matrix has then a set of eigenpairs 

!bt
\[
(\lambda_1,\bm{u}_1),\dots, (\lambda_n,\bm{u}_n),
!et
and the eigenvalues are given by the diagonal matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{\Sigma}=\mathrm{Diag}(\lambda_1, \dots,\lambda_n).
\]
!et
The matrix $\bm{X}$ can be written in terms of an orthogonal/unitary transformation $\bm{U}$
!bt
\[
\bm{X} = \bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T,
\]
!et
with $\bm{U}\bm{U}^T=\bm{I}$ or $\bm{U}\bm{U}^{\dagger}=\bm{I}$.

Not all square matrices are diagonalizable. A matrix like the one discussed above
!bt
\[
\bm{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1&  -1 \\
1& -1\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\]
!et
is not diagonalizable, it is a so-called "defective matrix":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_matrix". It is easy to see that the condition
$\bm{X}\bm{X}^T=\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is not fulfilled. 


!split
===== The SVD, a Fantastic Algorithm =====


However, and this is the strength of the SVD algorithm, any general
matrix $\bm{X}$ can be decomposed in terms of a diagonal matrix and
two orthogonal/unitary matrices.  The "Singular Value Decompostion
(SVD) theorem":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition"
states that a general $m\times n$ matrix $\bm{X}$ can be written in
terms of a diagonal matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ of dimensionality $n\times n$
and two orthognal matrices $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$, where the first has
dimensionality $m \times m$ and the last dimensionality $n\times n$.
We have then

!bt
\[ 
\bm{X} = \bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T 
\] 
!et 

As an example, the above defective matrix can be decomposed as

!bt
\[
\bm{X} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}  1&  1 \\ 1& -1\\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  2&  0 \\ 0& 0\\ \end{bmatrix}    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}  1&  -1 \\ 1& 1\\ \end{bmatrix}=\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T, 
\]
!et

with eigenvalues $\sigma_1=2$ and $\sigma_2=0$. 
The SVD exits always! 


!split
===== Another Example =====

Consider the following matrix which can be SVD decomposed as

!bt
\[
\bm{X} = \frac{1}{15}\begin{bmatrix} 14 & 2\\ 4 & 22\\ 16 & 13\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix}  1&  2 & 2 \\ 2& -1 & 1\\ 2 & 1& -2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}  2&  0 \\ 0& 1\\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\frac{1}{5}\begin{bmatrix}  3&  4 \\ 4& -3\end{bmatrix}=\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T. 
\]
!et

This is a $3\times 2$ matrix which is decomposed in terms of a
$3\times 3$ matrix $\bm{U}$, and a $2\times 2$ matrix $\bm{V}$. It is easy to see
that $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$ are orthogonal (how?). 

And the SVD
decomposition (singular values) gives eigenvalues 
$\sigma_i\geq\sigma_{i+1}$ for all $i$ and for dimensions larger than $i=2$, the
eigenvalues (singular values) are zero.

In the general case, where our design matrix $\bm{X}$ has dimension
$n\times p$, the matrix is thus decomposed into an $n\times n$
orthogonal matrix $\bm{U}$, a $p\times p$ orthogonal matrix $\bm{V}$
and a diagonal matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ with $r=\mathrm{min}(n,p)$
singular values $\sigma_i\geq 0$ on the main diagonal and zeros filling
the rest of the matrix.  There are at most $p$ singular values
assuming that $n > p$. In our regression examples for the nuclear
masses and the equation of state this is indeed the case, while for
the Ising model we have $p > n$. These are often cases that lead to
near singular or singular matrices.

The columns of $\bm{U}$ are called the left singular vectors while the columns of $\bm{V}$ are the right singular vectors.

!split
===== Economy-size SVD =====

If we assume that $n > p$, then our matrix $\bm{U}$ has dimension $n
\times n$. The last $n-p$ columns of $\bm{U}$ become however
irrelevant in our calculations since they are multiplied with the
zeros in $\bm{\Sigma}$.

The economy-size decomposition removes extra rows or columns of zeros
from the diagonal matrix of singular values, $\bm{\Sigma}$, along with the columns
in either $\bm{U}$ or $\bm{V}$ that multiply those zeros in the expression. 
Removing these zeros and columns can improve execution time
and reduce storage requirements without compromising the accuracy of
the decomposition.

If $n > p$, we keep only the first $p$ columns of $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{\Sigma}$ has dimension $p\times p$. 
If $p > n$, then only the first $n$ columns of $\bm{V}$ are computed and $\bm{\Sigma}$ has dimension $n\times n$.
The $n=p$ case is obvious, we retain the full SVD. 
In general the economy-size SVD leads to less FLOPS and still conserving the desired accuracy.

!split
===== Mathematical Properties =====

There are several interesting mathematical properties which will be
relevant when we are going to discuss the differences between say
ordinary least squares (OLS) and _Ridge_ regression.

We have from OLS that the parameters of the linear approximation are given by
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta} = \bm{X}\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}. 
\]
!et

The matrix to invert can be rewritten in terms of our SVD decomposition as

!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X} = \bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{U}^T\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T.
\]
!et
Using the orthogonality properties of $\bm{U}$ we have

!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X} = \bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T =  \bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T,
\]
!et
with $\bm{D}$ being a diagonal matrix with values along the diagonal given by the singular values squared. 

This means that
!bt
\[
(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})\bm{V} = \bm{V}\bm{D},
\]
!et
that is the eigenvectors of $(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})$ are given by the columns of the right singular matrix of $\bm{X}$ and the eigenvalues are the squared singular values.  It is easy to show (show this) that
!bt
\[
(\bm{X}\bm{X}^T)\bm{U} = \bm{U}\bm{D},
\]
!et
that is, the eigenvectors of $(\bm{X}\bm{X})^T$ are the columns of the left singular matrix and the eigenvalues are the same. 

Going back to our OLS equation we have
!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{\beta} = \bm{X}\left(\bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T \right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\bm{U\Sigma V^T}\left(\bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T \right)^{-1}(\bm{U\Sigma V^T})^T\bm{y}=\bm{U}\bm{U}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et
We will come back to this expression when we discuss Ridge regression. 


!split
===== Ridge and LASSO Regression =====

Let us remind ourselves about the expression for the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) which we used to define our cost function and the equations for the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, that is 
our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\beta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. By defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et

we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 

Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et


!split
===== More on Ridge Regression =====

Using the matrix-vector expression for Ridge regression,

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})^T(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})\right\}+\lambda\bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta},
\]
!et

by taking the derivatives with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ we obtain then
a slightly modified matrix inversion problem which for finite values
of $\lambda$ does not suffer from singularity problems. We obtain

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}+\lambda\bm{I}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y},
\]
!et

with $\bm{I}$ being a $p\times p$ identity matrix with the constraint that

!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \beta_i^2 \leq t,
\]
!et

with $t$ a finite positive number. 

We see that Ridge regression is nothing but the standard
OLS with a modified diagonal term added to $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. The
consequences, in particular for our discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff 
are rather interesting.

Furthermore, if we use the result above in terms of the SVD decomposition (our analysis was done for the OLS method), we had
!bt
\[
(\bm{X}\bm{X}^T)\bm{U} = \bm{U}\bm{D}.
\]
!et

We can  analyse the OLS solutions in terms of the eigenvectors (the columns) of the right singular value matrix $\bm{U}$ as
!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{\beta} = \bm{X}\left(\bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T \right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\bm{U\Sigma V^T}\left(\bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T \right)^{-1}(\bm{U\Sigma V^T})^T\bm{y}=\bm{U}\bm{U}^T\bm{y}
\]
!et


For Ridge regression this becomes

!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \bm{U\Sigma V^T}\left(\bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^T+\lambda\bm{I} \right)^{-1}(\bm{U\Sigma V^T})^T\bm{y}=\sum_{j=0}^{p-1}\bm{u}_j\bm{u}_j^T\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda}\bm{y},
\]
!et

with the vectors $\bm{u}_j$ being the columns of $\bm{U}$. 

!split
===== Interpreting the Ridge results =====

Since $\lambda \geq 0$, it means that compared to OLS, we have 

!bt
\[
\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda} \leq 1. 
\]
!et

Ridge regression finds the coordinates of $\bm{y}$ with respect to the
orthonormal basis $\bm{U}$, it then shrinks the coordinates by
$\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda}$. Recall that the SVD has
eigenvalues ordered in a descending way, that is $\sigma_i \geq
\sigma_{i+1}$.

For small eigenvalues $\sigma_i$ it means that their contributions become less important, a fact which can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom.
Actually, calculating the variance of $\bm{X}\bm{v}_j$ shows that this quantity is equal to $\sigma_j^2/n$.
With a parameter $\lambda$ we can thus shrink the role of specific parameters.  


!split
===== More interpretations =====

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that the design matrix is orthonormal, that is 

!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}=(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1} =\bm{I}. 
\]
!et

In this case the standard OLS results in 
!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}} = \bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\bm{u}_j\bm{u}_j^T\bm{y},
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \left(\bm{I}+\lambda\bm{I}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\left(1+\lambda\right)^{-1}\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}},
\]
!et

that is the Ridge estimator scales the OLS estimator by the inverse of a factor $1+\lambda$, and
the Ridge estimator converges to zero when the hyperparameter goes to
infinity.

We will come back to more interpretations after we have gone through some of the statistical analysis part. 

For more discussions of Ridge and Lasso regression, "Wessel van Wieringen's":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09169" article is highly recommended.
Similarly, "Mehta et al's article":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823" is also recommended.

The matrix $\bm{X}$ has columns that are linearly dependent. The first
column is the row-wise sum of the other two columns. The rank of a
matrix (the column rank) is the dimension of space spanned by the
column vectors. The rank of the matrix is the number of linearly
independent columns, in this case just $2$. We see this from the
singular values when running the above code. Running the standard
inversion algorithm for matrix inversion with $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ results
in the program terminating due to a singular matrix.



!split
===== Where are we going? =====

Before we proceed, we need to rethink what we have been doing. In our
eager to fit the data, we have omitted several important elements in
our regression analysis. In what follows we will
o look at statistical properties, including a discussion of mean values, variance and the so-called bias-variance tradeoff
o introduce resampling techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping and jackknife and more

This will allow us to link the standard linear algebra methods we have discussed above to a statistical interpretation of the methods. 





!split
===== Resampling methods =====
!bblock
Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern
statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training
set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to
obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in
order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can
repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear
regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which
the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain
information that would not be available from fitting the model only
once using the original training sample.

Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,
o The _bootstrap method_
o and _Cross-Validation_

In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular
cross-validation and the bootstrap method. 


!eblock


!split
===== Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive =====
!bblock

Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they
involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using
different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent
advances in computing power, the computational requirements of
resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we
discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,
cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools
in the practical application of many statistical learning
procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the
test error associated with a given statistical learning method in
order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level
of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model’s performance is
known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper
level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection. The
bootstrap is widely used.

* Our simulations can be treated as *computer experiments*. This is particularly the case for Monte Carlo methods

!eblock    



!split
===== Statistics  ===== 
!bblock
The *probability distribution function (PDF)* is a function
$p(x)$ on the domain which, in the discrete case, gives us the
probability or relative frequency with which these values of $X$ occur:
!bt
\[
p(x) = \mathrm{prob}(X=x)
\]
!et
In the continuous case, the PDF does not directly depict the
actual probability. Instead we define the probability for the
stochastic variable to assume any value on an infinitesimal interval
around $x$ to be $p(x)dx$. The continuous function $p(x)$ then gives us
the *density* of the probability rather than the probability
itself. The probability for a stochastic variable to assume any value
on a non-infinitesimal interval $[a,\,b]$ is then just the integral:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{prob}(a\leq X\leq b) = \int_a^b p(x)dx
\]
!et
Qualitatively speaking, a stochastic variable represents the values of
numbers chosen as if by chance from some specified PDF so that the
selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces this PDF.

===== Statistics, moments =====
!bblock
A particularly useful class of special expectation values are the
*moments*. The $n$-th moment of the PDF $p$ is defined as
follows:
!bt
\[
\langle x^n\rangle \equiv \int\! x^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th moment $\langle 1\rangle$ is just the normalization condition of
$p$. The first moment, $\langle x\rangle$, is called the *mean* of $p$
and often denoted by the letter $\mu$:
!bt
\[
\langle x\rangle = \mu \equiv \int\! x p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, central moments =====
!bblock
A special version of the moments is the set of *central moments*,
the n-th central moment defined as:
!bt
\[
\langle (x-\langle x \rangle )^n\rangle \equiv \int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th and first central moments are both trivial, equal $1$ and
$0$, respectively. But the second central moment, known as the
*variance* of $p$, is of particular interest. For the stochastic
variable $X$, the variance is denoted as $\sigma^2_X$ or $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
!bt
\begin{align}
\sigma^2_X\ \ =\ \ \mathrm{var}(X) & =  \langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle =
\int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^2 p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \int\! \left(x^2 - 2 x \langle x\rangle^{2} +
  \langle x\rangle^2\right)p(x)\,dx\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - 2 \langle x\rangle\langle x\rangle + \langle x\rangle^2\\
& =  \langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2
\end{align}
!et
The square root of the variance, $\sigma =\sqrt{\langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle}$ is called the *standard deviation* of $p$. It is clearly just the RMS (root-mean-square)
value of the deviation of the PDF from its mean value, interpreted
qualitatively as the *spread* of $p$ around its mean.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, covariance =====
!bblock
Another important quantity is the so called covariance, a variant of
the above defined variance. Consider again the set $\{X_i\}$ of $n$
stochastic variables (not necessarily uncorrelated) with the
multivariate PDF $P(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. The *covariance* of two
of the stochastic variables, $X_i$ and $X_j$, is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &\equiv \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\nonumber\\
&=
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!(x_i-\langle x_i \rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j \rangle)\,
P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
label{eq:def_covariance}
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\[
\langle x_i\rangle =
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!x_i\,P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more covariance  =====
!bblock
If we consider the above covariance as a matrix $C_{ij}=\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j)$, then the diagonal elements are just the familiar
variances, $C_{ii} = \mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_i) = \mathrm{var}(X_i)$. It turns out that
all the off-diagonal elements are zero if the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated. This is easy to show, keeping in mind the linearity of
the expectation value. Consider the stochastic variables $X_i$ and
$X_j$, ($i\neq j$):
!bt
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &= \langle(x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j - x_i\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle x_j + \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle \\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\langle x_j\rangle\rangle - \langle \langle x_i\rangle x_j\rangle +
\langle \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle +
\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\\
&=\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle
\end{align}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Covariance example =====

Suppose we have defined three vectors $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ with
$n$ elements each. The covariance matrix is defined as


!bt
\[
\hat{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\
                              \sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\
                              \sigma_{zx} & \sigma_{zy} & \sigma_{zz}
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where for example
!bt
\[
\sigma_{xy} =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i- \overline{x})(y_i- \overline{y}).
\]
!et

The Numpy function _np.cov_ calculates the covariance elements using
the factor $1/(n-1)$ instead of $1/n$ since it assumes we do not have
the exact mean values.

The following simple function uses the _np.vstack_ function which
takes each vector of dimension $1\times n$ and produces a $3\times n$
matrix $\hat{W}$

!bt
\[
\hat{W} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 & y_0 & z_0 \\
                          x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
                          x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
                          \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                          x_{n-2} & y_{n-2} & z_{n-2} \\
                          x_{n-1} & y_{n-1} & z_{n-1}
             \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

which in turn is converted into into the $3\times 3$ covariance matrix
$\hat{\Sigma}$ via the Numpy function _np.cov()_. We note that we can
also calculate the mean value of each set of samples $\hat{x}$ etc
using the Numpy function _np.mean(x)_. We can also extract the
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix through the _np.linalg.eig()_
function.

===== Statistics, independent variables  =====
!bblock
If $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent, we get 
$\langle x_i x_j\rangle =\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle$, resulting in $\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = 0\ \ (i\neq j)$.

Also useful for us is the covariance of linear combinations of
stochastic variables. Let $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ be two sets of
stochastic variables. Let also $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$ be two sets of
scalars. Consider the linear combination:
!bt
\[
U = \sum_i a_i X_i \qquad V = \sum_j b_j Y_j
\]
!et
By the linearity of the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(U, V) = \sum_{i,j}a_i b_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, Y_j)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, more variance  =====
!bblock
Now, since the variance is just $\mathrm{var}(X_i) = \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i)$, we get
the variance of the linear combination $U = \sum_i a_i X_i$:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_{i,j}a_i a_j \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:variance_linear_combination}
\end{equation}
!et
And in the special case when the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated, the off-diagonal elements of the covariance are as we
know zero, resulting in:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(U) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(\sum_i a_i X_i) = \sum_i a_i^2 \mathrm{var}(X_i)
\]
!et
which will become very useful in our study of the error in the mean
value of a set of measurements.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and stochastic processes  =====
!bblock
A *stochastic process* is a process that produces sequentially a
chain of values:
!bt
\[
\{x_1, x_2,\dots\,x_k,\dots\}.
\]
!et
We will call these
values our *measurements* and the entire set as our measured
*sample*.  The action of measuring all the elements of a sample
we will call a stochastic *experiment* since, operationally,
they are often associated with results of empirical observation of
some physical or mathematical phenomena; precisely an experiment. We
assume that these values are distributed according to some 
PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$, where $X$ is just the formal symbol for the
stochastic variable whose PDF is $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$. Instead of
trying to determine the full distribution $p$ we are often only
interested in finding the few lowest moments, like the mean
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ and the variance $\sigma_X^{\phantom X}$.
!eblock


!split 
===== Statistics and sample variables  =====
!bblock
In practical situations a sample is always of finite size. Let that
size be $n$. The expectation value of a sample, the *sample mean*, is then defined as follows:
!bt
\[
\bar{x}_n \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k
\]
!et
The *sample variance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar{x}_n)^2
\]
!et
its square root being the *standard deviation of the sample*. The
*sample covariance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(x)\equiv\frac{1}{n}\sum_{kl}(x_k - \bar{x}_n)(x_l - \bar{x}_n)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, sample variance and covariance =====
!bblock
Note that the sample variance is the sample covariance without the
cross terms. In a similar manner as the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:def_covariance}) is a measure of the correlation between
two stochastic variables, the above defined sample covariance is a
measure of the sequential correlation between succeeding measurements
of a sample.

These quantities, being known experimental values, differ
significantly from and must not be confused with the similarly named
quantities for stochastic variables, mean $\mu_X$, variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$
and covariance $\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)$.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics, law of large numbers =====
!bblock
The law of large numbers
states that as the size of our sample grows to infinity, the sample
mean approaches the true mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ of the chosen PDF:
!bt
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{x}_n = \mu_X^{\phantom X}
\]
!et
The sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ works therefore as an estimate of the true
mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$.

What we need to find out is how good an approximation $\bar{x}_n$ is to
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$. In any stochastic measurement, an estimated
mean is of no use to us without a measure of its error. A quantity
that tells us how well we can reproduce it in another experiment. We
are therefore interested in the PDF of the sample mean itself. Its
standard deviation will be a measure of the spread of sample means,
and we will simply call it the *error* of the sample mean, or
just sample error, and denote it by $\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$. In
practice, we will only be able to produce an *estimate* of the
sample error since the exact value would require the knowledge of the
true PDFs behind, which we usually do not have.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics, more on sample error =====
!bblock
Let us first take a look at what happens to the sample error as the
size of the sample grows. In a sample, each of the measurements $x_i$
can be associated with its own stochastic variable $X_i$. The
stochastic variable $\overline X_n$ for the sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ is
then just a linear combination, already familiar to us:
!bt
\[
\overline X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\]
!et
All the coefficients are just equal $1/n$. The PDF of $\overline X_n$,
denoted by $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ is the desired PDF of the sample
means. 
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics  =====
!bblock
The probability density of obtaining a sample mean $\bar x_n$
is the product of probabilities of obtaining arbitrary values $x_1,
x_2,\dots,x_n$ with the constraint that the mean of the set $\{x_i\}$
is $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\[
p_{\overline X_n}(x) = \int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_1)\cdots
\int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_n)\ 
\delta\!\left(x - \frac{x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n}{n}\right)dx_n \cdots dx_1
\]
!et
And in particular we are interested in its variance $\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$.
!eblock



!split
===== Statistics, central limit theorem =====
!bblock
It is generally not possible to express $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ in a
closed form given an arbitrary PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}$ and a number
$n$. But for the limit $n\to\infty$ it is possible to make an
approximation. The very important result is called *the central limit theorem*. It tells us that as $n$ goes to infinity,
$p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ approaches a Gaussian distribution whose mean
and variance equal the true mean and variance, $\mu_{X}^{\phantom X}$
and $\sigma_{X}^{2}$, respectively:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\overline X_n}(x) =
\left(\frac{n}{2\pi\mathrm{var}(X)}\right)^{1/2}
e^{-\frac{n(x-\bar x_n)^2}{2\mathrm{var}(X)}}
label{eq:central_limit_gaussian}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split 
===== Linking the regression analysis with a statistical interpretation =====

Finally, we are going to discuss several statistical properties which can be obtained in terms of analytical expressions. 
The
advantage of doing linear regression is that we actually end up with
analytical expressions for several statistical quantities.  
Standard least squares and Ridge regression  allow us to
derive quantities like the variance and other expectation values in a
rather straightforward way.


It is assumed that $\varepsilon_i
\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and the $\varepsilon_{i}$ are
independent, i.e.: 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mbox{Cov}(\varepsilon_{i_1},
\varepsilon_{i_2}) & = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc} \sigma^2 & \mbox{if}
& i_1 = i_2, \\ 0 & \mbox{if} & i_1 \not= i_2.  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*} 
!et
The randomness of $\varepsilon_i$ implies that
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is also a random variable. In particular,
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is normally distributed, because $\varepsilon_i \sim
\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast} \, \bm{\beta}$ is a
non-random scalar. To specify the parameters of the distribution of
$\mathbf{y}_i$ we need to calculate its first two moments. 

Recall that $\bm{X}$ is a matrix of dimensionality $n\times p$. The
notation above $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast}$ means that we are looking at the
row number $i$ and perform a sum over all values $p$.


!split
===== Assumptions made =====

The assumption we have made here can be summarized as (and this is going to be useful when we discuss the bias-variance trade off)
that there exists a function $f(\bm{x})$ and  a normal distributed error $\bm{\varepsilon}\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
which describe our data
!bt
\[
\bm{y} = f(\bm{x})+\bm{\varepsilon}
\]
!et

We approximate this function with our model from the solution of the linear regression equations, that is our
function $f$ is approximated by $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ where we want to minimize $(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2$, our MSE, with
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Expectation value and variance =====

We can calculate the expectation value of $\bm{y}$ for a given element $i$ 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mathbb{E}(y_i) & =
\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}) + \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i)
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta, 
\end{align*} 
!et
while
its variance is 
!bt
\begin{align*} \mbox{Var}(y_i) & = \mathbb{E} \{ [y_i
- \mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2 \} \, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbb{E} ( y_i^2 ) -
[\mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2  \\  & = \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \,
\beta + \varepsilon_i )^2] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 \\ &
= \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2 \varepsilon_i
\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} + \varepsilon_i^2 ] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i,
\ast} \, \beta)^2 \\  & = ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i) \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} +
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 
\\ & = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) \, \, \, = \, \, \,
\mbox{Var}(\varepsilon_i) \, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2.  
\end{align*}
!et
Hence, $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}, \sigma^2)$, that is $\bm{y}$ follows a normal distribution with 
mean value $\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2$ (not be confused with the singular values of the SVD). 

!split
===== Expectation value and variance for $\bm{\beta}$ =====

With the OLS expressions for the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ we can evaluate the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta}) = \mathbb{E}[ (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbb{E}[ \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}\bm{\beta}=\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et
This means that the estimator of the regression parameters is unbiased.

We can also calculate the variance

The variance of $\bm{\beta}$ is
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}) & = & \mathbb{E} \{ [\bm{\beta} - \mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta})] [\bm{\beta} - \mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta})]^{T} \}
\\
& = & \mathbb{E} \{ [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} - \bm{\beta}] \, [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} - \bm{\beta}]^{T} \}
\\
% & = & \mathbb{E} \{ [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}] \, [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}]^{T} \} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
% & = & \mathbb{E} \{ (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}  \} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
& = & (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \, \mathbb{E} \{ \mathbf{Y} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T} \} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
\\
& = & (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \, \{ \mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T} \,  \mathbf{X}^{T} + \sigma^2 \} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
% & = & (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^T \, \mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^T \,  \mathbf{X}^T \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^T % \mathbf{X})^{-1}
% \\
% & & + \, \, \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^T  \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \bm{\beta}^T
\\
& = & \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}  + \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1},
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

where we have used  that $\mathbb{E} (\mathbf{Y} \mathbf{Y}^{T}) =
\mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} +
\sigma^2 \, \mathbf{I}_{nn}$. From $\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}) = \sigma^2
\, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}$, one obtains an estimate of the
variance of the estimate of the $j$-th regression coefficient:
$\hat{\sigma}^2 (\hat{\beta}_j ) = \hat{\sigma}^2 \sqrt{
[(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}]_{jj} }$. This may be used to
construct a confidence interval for the estimates.


In a similar way, we can obtain analytical expressions for say the
expectation values of the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ and their variance
when we employ Ridge regression, allowing us again to define a confidence interval. 

It is rather straightforward to show that
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I}_{pp})^{-1} (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}.
\]
!et
We see clearly that 
$\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big] \not= \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We say then that the ridge estimator is biased.

We can also compute the variance as 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}}]=\sigma^2[  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T},
\]
!et
and it is easy to see that if the parameter $\lambda$ goes to infinity then the variance of Ridge parameters $\bm{\beta}$ goes to zero. 

With this, we can compute the difference 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}]-\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}})=\sigma^2 [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}[ 2\lambda\mathbf{I} + \lambda^2 (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} ] \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T}.
\]
!et
The difference is non-negative definite since each component of the
matrix product is non-negative definite. 
This means the variance we obtain with the standard OLS will always for $\lambda > 0$ be larger than the variance of $\bm{\beta}$ obtained with the Ridge estimator. This has interesting consequences when we discuss the so-called bias-variance trade-off below. 


!split
===== Resampling methods =====

With all these analytical equations for both the OLS and Ridge
regression, we will now outline how to assess a given model. This will
lead us to a discussion of the so-called bias-variance tradeoff (see
below) and so-called resampling methods.

One of the quantities we have discussed as a way to measure errors is
the mean-squared error (MSE), mainly used for fitting of continuous
functions. Another choice is the absolute error.

In the discussions below we will focus on the MSE and in particular since we will split the data into test and training data,
we discuss the
o prediction error or simply the _test error_, where we have a fixed training set and the test error is the MSE arising from the data reserved for testing. We discuss also the 
o training error $\mathrm{Err_{Train}}$, which is the average loss over the training data.

As our model becomes more and more complex, more of the training data
tends to used. The training may thence adapt to more complicated
structures in the data. This may lead to a decrease in the bias (see
below for code example) and a slight increase of the variance for the
test error.  For a certain level of complexity the test error will
reach a minimum, before starting to increase again. The training error
reaches a saturation.




!split
===== Resampling methods: Jackknife and Bootstrap =====

Two famous
resampling methods are the _independent bootstrap_ and _the jackknife_. 

The jackknife is a special case of the independent bootstrap. Still, the jackknife was made
popular prior to the independent bootstrap. And as the popularity of
the independent bootstrap soared, new variants, such as _the dependent bootstrap_.

The Jackknife and independent bootstrap work for
independent, identically distributed random variables.
If these conditions are not
satisfied, the methods will fail.  Yet, it should be said that if the data are
independent, identically distributed, and we only want to estimate the
variance of $\overline{X}$ (which often is the case), then there is no
need for bootstrapping. 

!split
===== Resampling methods: Jackknife =====

The Jackknife works by making many replicas of the estimator $\widehat{\theta}$. 
The jackknife is a resampling method where we systematically leave out one observation from the vector of observed values $\bm{x} = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,X_n)$. 
Let $\bm{x}_i$ denote the vector
!bt
\[
\bm{x}_i = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\cdots,x_n),
\]
!et

which equals the vector $\bm{x}$ with the exception that observation
number $i$ is left out. Using this notation, define
$\widehat{\theta}_i$ to be the estimator
$\widehat{\theta}$ computed using $\vec{X}_i$.

===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap =====
!bblock
Bootstrapping is a nonparametric approach to statistical inference
that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional
assumptions and asymptotic results. Bootstrapping offers a number of
advantages: 
o The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  
o Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  
o It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. 
o It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratified and clustered samples).
!eblock


!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap background =====

Since $\widehat{\theta} = \widehat{\theta}(\bm{X})$ is a function of random variables,
$\widehat{\theta}$ itself must be a random variable. Thus it has
a pdf, call this function $p(\bm{t})$. The aim of the bootstrap is to
estimate $p(\bm{t})$ by the relative frequency of
$\widehat{\theta}$. You can think of this as using a histogram
in the place of $p(\bm{t})$. If the relative frequency closely
resembles $p(\vec{t})$, then using numerics, it is straight forward to
estimate all the interesting parameters of $p(\bm{t})$ using point
estimators.  


!split
===== Resampling methods: More Bootstrap background =====

In the case that $\widehat{\theta}$ has
more than one component, and the components are independent, we use the
same estimator on each component separately.  If the probability
density function of $X_i$, $p(x)$, had been known, then it would have
been straight forward to do this by: 
o Drawing lots of numbers from $p(x)$, suppose we call one such set of numbers $(X_1^*, X_2^*, \cdots, X_n^*)$. 
o Then using these numbers, we could compute a replica of $\widehat{\theta}$ called $\widehat{\theta}^*$. 

By repeated use of (1) and (2), many
estimates of $\widehat{\theta}$ could have been obtained. The
idea is to use the relative frequency of $\widehat{\theta}^*$
(think of a histogram) as an estimate of $p(\bm{t})$.

!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap approach =====

But
unless there is enough information available about the process that
generated $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$, $p(x)$ is in general
unknown. Therefore, "Efron in 1979":"https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344552"  asked the
question: What if we replace $p(x)$ by the relative frequency
of the observation $X_i$; if we draw observations in accordance with
the relative frequency of the observations, will we obtain the same
result in some asymptotic sense? The answer is yes.


Instead of generating the histogram for the relative
frequency of the observation $X_i$, just draw the values
$(X_1^*,X_2^*,\cdots,X_n^*)$ with replacement from the vector
$\bm{X}$. 

!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap steps =====

The independent bootstrap works like this: 

o Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\bm{x} = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$. 
o Define a vector $\bm{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\bm{x}$. 
o Using the vector $\bm{x}^*$ compute $\widehat{\theta}^*$ by evaluating $\widehat \theta$ under the observations $\bm{x}^*$. 
o Repeat this process $k$ times. 

When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency
of $\widehat \theta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability
distribution $p(t)$. Using this probability distribution you can
estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the
histogram of the relative frequency of $\widehat{\theta}^*$. Instead
you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For
example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\widehat
\theta$, apply the etsimator $\widehat \sigma^2$ to the values
$\widehat \theta ^*$.


!split
===== Code example for the Bootstrap method =====

The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value
$\mu =100$ and variance $\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data
used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data
set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have
data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each
bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method
shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian,
centered around the mean value $\mu=100$ but with standard deviation
$\sigma/\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in
this case the same as the number of original data points). The value
of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit
theorem.

===== Various steps in cross-validation =====

When the repetitive splitting of the data set is done randomly,
samples may accidently end up in a fast majority of the splits in
either training or test set. Such samples may have an unbalanced
influence on either model building or prediction evaluation. To avoid
this $k$-fold cross-validation structures the data splitting. The
samples are divided into $k$ more or less equally sized exhaustive and
mutually exclusive subsets. In turn (at each split) one of these
subsets plays the role of the test set while the union of the
remaining subsets constitutes the training set. Such a splitting
warrants a balanced representation of each sample in both training and
test set over the splits. Still the division into the $k$ subsets
involves a degree of randomness. This may be fully excluded when
choosing $k=n$. This particular case is referred to as leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV). 

!split 
===== How to set up the cross-validation for Ridge and/or Lasso =====

* Define a range of interest for the penalty parameter.

* Divide the data set into training and test set comprising samples $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus i$ and $\{ i \}$, respectively.

* Fit the linear regression model by means of ridge estimation  for each $\lambda$ in the grid using the training set, and the corresponding estimate of the error variance $\bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)$, as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda) & =  ( \bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast} + \lambda \bm{I}_{pp})^{-1}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T} \bm{y}_{-i}
\end{align*}
!et 

* Evaluate the prediction performance of these models on the test set by $\log\{L[y_i, \bm{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}$. Or, by the prediction error $|y_i - \bm{X}_{i, \ast} \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda)|$, the relative error, the error squared or the R2 score function.

* Repeat the first three steps  such that each sample plays the role of the test set once.

* Average the prediction performances of the test sets at each grid point of the penalty bias/parameter. It is an estimate of the prediction performance of the model corresponding to this value of the penalty parameter on novel data. It is defined as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\{L[y_i, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Cross-validation in brief =====

For the various values of $k$

o shuffle the dataset randomly.
o Split the dataset into $k$ groups.
o For each unique group:
 o Decide which group to use as set for test data
 o Take the remaining groups as a training data set
 o Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
 o Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
o Summarize the model using the sample of model evaluation scores

===== The bias-variance tradeoff =====


We will discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of
continuous predictions such as regression. However, many of the
intuitions and ideas discussed here also carry over to classification
tasks. Consider a dataset $\mathcal{L}$ consisting of the data
$\mathbf{X}_\mathcal{L}=\{(y_j, \boldsymbol{x}_j), j=0\ldots n-1\}$. 

Let us assume that the true data is generated from a noisy model

!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x}) + \bm{\epsilon}
\]
!et

where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma^2$.

In our derivation of the ordinary least squares method we defined then
an approximation to the function $f$ in terms of the parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ and the design matrix $\bm{X}$ which embody our model,
that is $\bm{\tilde{y}}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$. 

Thereafter we found the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ by optimizing the means squared error via the so-called cost function
!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta}) =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right].
\]
!et

We can rewrite this as 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(f_i-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2+\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(\tilde{y}_i-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2+\sigma^2.
\]
!et

The three terms represent the square of the bias of the learning
method, which can be thought of as the error caused by the simplifying
assumptions built into the method. The second term represents the
variance of the chosen model and finally the last terms is variance of
the error $\bm{\epsilon}$.

To derive this equation, we need to recall that the variance of $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{\epsilon}$ are both equal to $\sigma^2$. The mean value of $\bm{\epsilon}$ is by definition equal to zero. Furthermore, the function $f$ is not a stochastics variable, idem for $\bm{\tilde{y}}$.
We use a more compact notation in terms of the expectation value 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{f}+\bm{\epsilon}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right],
\]
!et
and adding and subtracting $\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]$ we get
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{f}+\bm{\epsilon}-\bm{\tilde{y}}+\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2\right],
\]
!et
which, using the abovementioned expectation values can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2\right]+\mathrm{Var}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]+\sigma^2,
\]
!et
that is the rewriting in terms of the so-called bias, the variance of the model $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ and the variance of $\bm{\epsilon}$.

===== Summing up ===== 




The bias-variance tradeoff summarizes the fundamental tension in
machine learning, particularly supervised learning, between the
complexity of a model and the amount of training data needed to train
it.  Since data is often limited, in practice it is often useful to
use a less-complex model with higher bias, that is  a model whose asymptotic
performance is worse than another model because it is easier to
train and less sensitive to sampling noise arising from having a
finite-sized training dataset (smaller variance). 



The above equations tell us that in
order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a
statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance
and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity,
and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the expected
test MSE can never lie below $Var(\epsilon)$, the irreducible error.


What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning
method? The variance refers to the amount by which our model would change if we
estimated it using a different training data set. Since the training
data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different
training data sets  will result in a different estimate. But ideally the
estimate for our model should not vary too much between training
sets. However, if a method has high variance  then small changes in
the training data can result in large changes in the model. In general, more
flexible statistical methods have higher variance.

============================
Underfitting vs. Overfitting
============================

This example demonstrates the problems of underfitting and overfitting and
how we can use linear regression with polynomial features to approximate
nonlinear functions. The plot shows the function that we want to approximate,
which is a part of the cosine function. In addition, the samples from the
real function and the approximations of different models are displayed. The
models have polynomial features of different degrees. We can see that a
linear function (polynomial with degree 1) is not sufficient to fit the
training samples. This is called **underfitting**. A polynomial of degree 4
approximates the true function almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees
the model will **overfit** the training data, i.e. it learns the noise of the
training data.
We evaluate quantitatively **overfitting** / **underfitting** by using
cross-validation. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) on the validation
set, the higher, the less likely the model generalizes correctly from the
training data.

=====  The Ising model =====

The one-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor interaction, no
external field and a constant coupling constant $J$ is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = -J \sum_{k}^L s_k s_{k + 1},
\end{align}
!et

where $s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $s_{N + 1} = s_1$. The number of spins
in the system is determined by $L$. For the one-dimensional system
there is no phase transition.

We will look at a system of $L = 40$ spins with a coupling constant of
$J = 1$. To get enough training data we will generate 10000 states
with their respective energies.


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.linalg as scl
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tqdm
sns.set(color_codes=True)
cmap_args=dict(vmin=-1., vmax=1., cmap='seismic')

L = 40
n = int(1e4)

spins = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(n, L))
J = 1.0

energies = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    energies[i] = - J * np.dot(spins[i], np.roll(spins[i], 1))
!ec

Here we use ordinary least squares
regression to predict the energy for the nearest neighbor
one-dimensional Ising model on a ring, i.e., the endpoints wrap
around. We will use linear regression to fit a value for
the coupling constant to achieve this.

!split
===== Reformulating the problem to suit regression =====

A more general form for the one-dimensional Ising model is

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = - \sum_j^L \sum_k^L s_j s_k J_{jk}.
\end{align}
!et

Here we allow for interactions beyond the nearest neighbors and a state dependent
coupling constant. This latter expression can be formulated as
a matrix-product
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{H} = \bm{X} J,
\end{align}
!et

where $X_{jk} = s_j s_k$ and $J$ is a matrix which consists of the
elements $-J_{jk}$. This form of writing the energy fits perfectly
with the form utilized in linear regression, that is

!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{y} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon},
\end{align}
!et

We split the data in training and test data as discussed in the previous example

!bc pycod
X = np.zeros((n, L ** 2))
for i in range(n):
    X[i] = np.outer(spins[i], spins[i]).ravel()
y = energies
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
!ec

!split
===== Linear regression =====

In the ordinary least squares method we choose the cost function

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta})= \frac{1}{n}\left\{(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})\right\}.
\end{align}
!et

We then find the extremal point of $C$ by taking the derivative with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ as discussed above.
This yields the expression for $\bm{\beta}$ to be

!bt
\[
    \bm{\beta} = \frac{\bm{X}^T \bm{y}}{\bm{X}^T \bm{X}},
\]
!et

which immediately imposes some requirements on $\bm{X}$ as there must exist
an inverse of $\bm{X}^T \bm{X}$. If the expression we are modeling contains an
intercept, i.e., a constant term, we must make sure that the
first column of $\bm{X}$ consists of $1$. We do this here

!bc pycod
X_train_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_train))[:, np.newaxis], X_train),
    axis=1
)
X_test_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_test))[:, np.newaxis], X_test),
    axis=1
)
!ec

!bc pycod
def ols_inv(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return scl.inv(x.T @ x) @ (x.T @ y)
beta = ols_inv(X_train_own, y_train)
!ec


!split
===== Singular Value decomposition =====

Doing the inversion directly turns out to be a bad idea since the matrix
$\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is singular. An alternative approach is to use the _singular
value decomposition_. Using the definition of the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse we can write the equation for $\bm{\beta}$ as

!bt
\[
    \bm{\beta} = \bm{X}^{+}\bm{y},
\]
!et

where the pseudoinverse of $\bm{X}$ is given by

!bt
\[
    \bm{X}^{+} = \frac{\bm{X}^T}{\bm{X}^T\bm{X}}.
\]
!et

Using singular value decomposition we can decompose the matrix  $\bm{X} = \bm{U}\bm{\Sigma} \bm{V}^T$,
where $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$ are orthogonal(unitary) matrices and $\bm{\Sigma}$ contains the singular values (more details below).
where $X^{+} = V\Sigma^{+} U^T$. This reduces the equation for
$\omega$ to
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{\beta} = \bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^{+} \bm{U}^T \bm{y}.
\end{align}
!et

Note that solving this equation by actually doing the pseudoinverse
(which is what we will do) is not a good idea as this operation scales
as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in a
general matrix. Instead, doing $QR$-factorization and solving the
linear system as an equation would reduce this down to
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operations.


!bc pycod
def ols_svd(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    u, s, v = scl.svd(x)
    return v.T @ scl.pinv(scl.diagsvd(s, u.shape[0], v.shape[0])) @ u.T @ y
!ec

!bc pycod
beta = ols_svd(X_train_own,y_train)
!ec

When extracting the $J$-matrix  we need to make sure that we remove the intercept, as is done here

!bc pycod
J = beta[1:].reshape(L, L)
!ec

A way of looking at the coefficients in $J$ is to plot the matrices as images.


!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J, **cmap_args)
plt.title("OLS", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec
It is interesting to note that OLS
considers both $J_{j, j + 1} = -0.5$ and $J_{j, j - 1} = -0.5$ as
valid matrix elements for $J$.
In our discussion below on hyperparameters and Ridge and Lasso regression we will see that
this problem can be removed, partly and only with Lasso regression. 

In this case our matrix inversion was actually possible. The obvious question now is what is the mathematics behind the SVD?





!split
===== The one-dimensional Ising model =====

Let us bring back the Ising model again, but now with an additional
focus on Ridge and Lasso regression as well. We repeat some of the
basic parts of the Ising model and the setup of the training and test
data.  The one-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor
interaction, no external field and a constant coupling constant $J$ is
given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = -J \sum_{k}^L s_k s_{k + 1},
\end{align}
!et
where $s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $s_{N + 1} = s_1$. The number of spins in the system is determined by $L$. For the one-dimensional system there is no phase transition.

We will look at a system of $L = 40$ spins with a coupling constant of $J = 1$. To get enough training data we will generate 10000 states with their respective energies.


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.linalg as scl
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import sklearn.linear_model as skl
import tqdm
sns.set(color_codes=True)
cmap_args=dict(vmin=-1., vmax=1., cmap='seismic')

L = 40
n = int(1e4)

spins = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(n, L))
J = 1.0

energies = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    energies[i] = - J * np.dot(spins[i], np.roll(spins[i], 1))
!ec

A more general form for the one-dimensional Ising model is

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = - \sum_j^L \sum_k^L s_j s_k J_{jk}.
\end{align}
!et

Here we allow for interactions beyond the nearest neighbors and a more
adaptive coupling matrix. This latter expression can be formulated as
a matrix-product on the form
!bt
\begin{align}
    H = X J,
\end{align}
!et

where $X_{jk} = s_j s_k$ and $J$ is the matrix consisting of the
elements $-J_{jk}$. This form of writing the energy fits perfectly
with the form utilized in linear regression, viz.
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{y} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon}.
\end{align}
!et
We organize the data as we did above
!bc pycod
X = np.zeros((n, L ** 2))
for i in range(n):
    X[i] = np.outer(spins[i], spins[i]).ravel()
y = energies
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.96)

X_train_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_train))[:, np.newaxis], X_train),
    axis=1
)

X_test_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_test))[:, np.newaxis], X_test),
    axis=1
)
!ec

We will do all fitting with _Scikit-Learn_,

!bc pycod
clf = skl.LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
!ec
When  extracting the $J$-matrix we make sure to remove the intercept
!bc pycod
J_sk = clf.coef_.reshape(L, L)
!ec
And then we plot the results
!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("LinearRegression from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec
The results perfectly with our previous discussion where we used our own code.

!split
===== Ridge regression =====

Having explored the ordinary least squares we move on to ridge
regression. In ridge regression we include a _regularizer_. This
involves a new cost function which leads to a new estimate for the
weights $\bm{\beta}$. This results in a penalized regression problem. The
cost function is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta}; \lambda) = (\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y}) + \lambda \bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta}.
\end{align}
!et
!bc pycod
_lambda = 0.1
clf_ridge = skl.Ridge(alpha=_lambda).fit(X_train, y_train)
J_ridge_sk = clf_ridge.coef_.reshape(L, L)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_ridge_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("Ridge from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)

plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== LASSO regression =====

In the _Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator_ (LASSO)-method we get a third cost function.

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta}; \lambda) = (\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y}) + \lambda \sqrt{\bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta}}.
\end{align}
!et

Finding the extremal point of this cost function is not so straight-forward as in least squares and ridge. We will therefore rely solely on the function ``Lasso`` from _Scikit-Learn_.

!bc pycod
clf_lasso = skl.Lasso(alpha=_lambda).fit(X_train, y_train)
J_lasso_sk = clf_lasso.coef_.reshape(L, L)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_lasso_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("Lasso from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)

plt.show()
!ec

It is quite striking how LASSO breaks the symmetry of the coupling
constant as opposed to ridge and OLS. We get a sparse solution with
$J_{j, j + 1} = -1$.



!split
===== Performance as  function of the regularization parameter =====

We see how the different models perform for a different set of values for $\lambda$.


!bc pycod
lambdas = np.logspace(-4, 5, 10)

train_errors = {
    "ols_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "ridge_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "lasso_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size)
}

test_errors = {
    "ols_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "ridge_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "lasso_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size)
}

plot_counter = 1

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(32, 54))

for i, _lambda in enumerate(tqdm.tqdm(lambdas)):
    for key, method in zip(
        ["ols_sk", "ridge_sk", "lasso_sk"],
        [skl.LinearRegression(), skl.Ridge(alpha=_lambda), skl.Lasso(alpha=_lambda)]
    ):
        method = method.fit(X_train, y_train)

        train_errors[key][i] = method.score(X_train, y_train)
        test_errors[key][i] = method.score(X_test, y_test)

        omega = method.coef_.reshape(L, L)

        plt.subplot(10, 5, plot_counter)
        plt.imshow(omega, **cmap_args)
        plt.title(r"%s, $\lambda = %.4f$" % (key, _lambda))
        plot_counter += 1

plt.show()
!ec

We see that LASSO reaches a good solution for low
values of $\lambda$, but will "wither" when we increase $\lambda$ too
much. Ridge is more stable over a larger range of values for
$\lambda$, but eventually also fades away.

!split
===== Finding the optimal value of $\lambda$ =====

To determine which value of $\lambda$ is best we plot the accuracy of
the models when predicting the training and the testing set. We expect
the accuracy of the training set to be quite good, but if the accuracy
of the testing set is much lower this tells us that we might be
subject to an overfit model. The ideal scenario is an accuracy on the
testing set that is close to the accuracy of the training set.


!bc pycod 
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))

colors = {
    "ols_sk": "r",
    "ridge_sk": "y",
    "lasso_sk": "c"
}

for key in train_errors:
    plt.semilogx(
        lambdas,
        train_errors[key],
        colors[key],
        label="Train {0}".format(key),
        linewidth=4.0
    )

for key in test_errors:
    plt.semilogx(
        lambdas,
        test_errors[key],
        colors[key] + "--",
        label="Test {0}".format(key),
        linewidth=4.0
    )
plt.legend(loc="best", fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel(r"$\lambda$", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel(r"$R^2$", fontsize=18)
plt.tick_params(labelsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec

From the above figure we can see that LASSO with $\lambda = 10^{-2}$
achieves a very good accuracy on the test set. This by far surpasses the
other models for all values of $\lambda$.
