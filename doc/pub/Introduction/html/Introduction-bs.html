<h1 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Introduction </h1>

<p>
During the last two decades there has been a swift and amazing
development of Machine Learning techniques and algorithms that impact
many areas in not only Science and Technology but also the Humanities,
Social Sciences, Medicine, Law, indeed, almost all possible
disciplines. The applications are incredibly many, from self-driving
cars to solving high-dimensional differential equations or complicated
quantum mechanical many-body problems. Machine Learning is perceived
by many as one of the main disruptive techniques nowadays.

<p>
Statistics, Data science and Machine Learning form important
fields of research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and
make predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract
important correlations about physical process and the underlying laws
of motion in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear
frequently in essentially all disciplines, from the traditional
Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life
Science, Law, education research, the Humanities and the Social
Sciences.

<h2 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Machine Learning, short overview  </h2>

<p>
Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is
that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns
in a broad class of data sets without having to write code
specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic
based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that
machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The
insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central
role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm.

<p>
Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young
age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in
computational capabilities have been followed by developments of
methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,
relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The
field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software libraries
written in Python for machine learning like
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_self">Scikit-learn</a>,
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_self">Tensorflow</a>,
<a href="http://pytorch.org/" target="_self">PyTorch</a> and <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_self">Keras</a>, all
freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass
communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of
code developers and contributors keeps increasing.

<h2 id="___sec2" class="anchor">A multidisciplinary approach </h2>

<p>
Not all the
algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical
justification (for example decision trees and random forests), opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and
trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a
solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability
theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte
Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many
of the algorithms and methods we will discuss.

<h2 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Learning outcomes </h2>

<p>
These sets of lectures aim at giving you an overview of central aspects of
statistical data analysis as well as some of the central algorithms
used in machine learning.  We will introduce a variety of central
algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and
machine learning.

<p>
Hands-on projects and experimenting with data and algorithms plays a central role in
these lectures, and our hope is, through the various examples discussed in this series of lectures,
to  expose you to fundamental
research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of
the art scientific results. You  will learn to develop and
structure codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with
computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A
good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the
course. More specifically, you will

<h2 id="___sec4" class="anchor">Types of Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into
two main categories.  In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a
problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other
hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em> is a method for finding patterns and
relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely
<em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by
behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,
solely from rewards and punishment.

<p>
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the
desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:

<ul>
  <li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>
  <li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>
  <li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec5" class="anchor">Choice of Programming Language </h2>

<p>
Python plays nowadays a central role in the development of machine
learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, seen
the wealth of machine learning and data analysis libraries written in
Python, easy to use libraries with immediate visualization(and not the
least impressive galleries of existing examples), the popularity of the
Jupyter notebook framework with the possibility to run <b>R</b> codes or
compiled programs written in C++, and much more made our choice of
programming language for this series of lectures easy. However,
since the focus here is not only on using existing Python libraries such
as <b>Scikit-Learn</b>, <b>Tensorflow</b> and <b>Pytorch</b>, but also on developing your own
algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these
algorithms either as a Python codes or C++ or Fortran (or other languages) codes.
