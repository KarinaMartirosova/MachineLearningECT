    "\n",
    "During the last two decades there has been a swift and amazing\n",
    "development of Machine Learning techniques and algorithms that impact\n",
    "many areas in not only Science and Technology but also the Humanities,\n",
    "Social Sciences, Medicine, Law, indeed, almost all possible\n",
    "disciplines. The applications are incredibly many, from self-driving\n",
    "cars to solving high-dimensional differential equations or complicated\n",
    "quantum mechanical many-body problems. Machine Learning is perceived\n",
    "by many as one of the main disruptive techniques nowadays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, Data science and Machine Learning form important\n",
    "fields of research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and\n",
    "make predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract\n",
    "important correlations about physical process and the underlying laws\n",
    "of motion in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear\n",
    "frequently in essentially all disciplines, from the traditional\n",

    "## Machine Learning, short overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",
    "role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young\n",
    "age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in\n",
    "computational capabilities have been followed by developments of\n",
    "methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,\n",
    "relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The\n",
    "field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software libraries\n",
    "written in Python for machine learning like\n",
    "[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), all\n",
    "freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass\n",
    "communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of\n",
    "code developers and contributors keeps increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A multidisciplinary approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",
    "justification (for example decision trees and random forests), opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and\n",
    "trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a\n",
    "solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability\n",
    "theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte\n",
    "Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many\n",
    "of the algorithms and methods we will discuss.\n",

    "to  expose you to fundamental\n",
    "research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of\n",
    "the art scientific results. You  will learn to develop and\n",
    "structure codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with\n",
    "computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A\n",
    "good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the\n",
    "course. More specifically, you will\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python plays nowadays a central role in the development of machine\n",
    "learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, seen\n",
    "the wealth of machine learning and data analysis libraries written in\n",
    "Python, easy to use libraries with immediate visualization(and not the\n",
    "least impressive galleries of existing examples), the popularity of the\n",
    "Jupyter notebook framework with the possibility to run **R** codes or\n",
    "compiled programs written in C++, and much more made our choice of\n",
    "programming language for this series of lectures easy. However,\n",
    "since the focus here is not only on using existing Python libraries such\n",
    "as **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow** and **Pytorch**, but also on developing your own\n",
    "algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these\n",
    "algorithms either as a Python codes or C++ or Fortran (or other languages) codes."
