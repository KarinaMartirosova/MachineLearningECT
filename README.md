# MachineLearningECT
Probability theory and statistical methods play a central role in science. Nowadays we are surrounded by huge amounts of data. For example, there are about one trillion web pages; more than one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube every second, amounting to 10 years of content every day; the genomes of 1000s of people, each of which has a length of more than a billion base pairs, have been sequenced by various labs and so on. This deluge of data calls for automated methods of data analysis, which is exactly what machine learning provides. The purpose of this summer school is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists and nuclear physicists in particular. We will start with some of the basic methods from supervised learning, such as various regression methods before we move into deep learning methods for 
both supervised and unsupervised learning, 
with an emphasis on the analysis of nuclear physics experiments and theoretical nuclear physics. 
Hands-on examples will be provided and the aim is to give the participants 
an overview on how machine learning can be used 
to analyze and study nuclear physics problems.
